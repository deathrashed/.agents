## NIST CSF 2.0 Overview

### What Changed in CSF 2.0

Released in February 2024, NIST CSF 2.0 represents a major evolution from the original 2014 framework and 2018 v1.1 update:

**Expanded Scope:** CSF 2.0 applies to ALL organizations — not just critical infrastructure. Small businesses, government agencies, higher education, and nonprofits are now explicitly in scope.

**New GOVERN Function:** The most significant change. GOVERN elevates cybersecurity governance to a top-level function, recognizing that executive leadership, policy, and oversight are prerequisites for effective cybersecurity.

**Enhanced Supply Chain Focus:** Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) is now a category under GOVERN, reflecting the reality that supply chain attacks are a primary threat vector.

**Improved Guidance:** CSF 2.0 includes implementation examples and quick-start guides that were absent in earlier versions. The framework is more actionable and prescriptive while maintaining its flexible, risk-based approach.

**Profile Updates:** Profiles are now more clearly defined as organizational profiles (describing current/target states) and community profiles (sector-specific templates).

- **Integrated Risk Management:** Awareness of risk at management level, some cybersecurity investment
- **External Participation:** Informal information sharing
- **Example:** Mid-size company with documented security policies, basic vulnerability scanning, security awareness training, but inconsistent implementation across departments

### Tier 3 — Repeatable

- **Risk Management Process:** Formal, expressed as policy, regularly updated
- **Integrated Risk Management:** Organization-wide risk-informed approach
- **External Participation:** Active participation in information sharing
- **Example:** Enterprise with comprehensive security program, SIEM/SOC, regular assessments, defined risk appetite, consistent policy enforcement, mature incident response

### Tier 4 — Adaptive

- **Risk Management Process:** Continuously improved based on lessons learned and predictive indicators
- **Integrated Risk Management:** Cybersecurity risk management is part of organizational culture
- **External Participation:** Active contribution to broader cybersecurity ecosystem
- **Example:** Organization using threat intelligence-driven defense, continuous control validation, automated response, adaptive risk management that adjusts in real-time to changing threat landscape

## Maturity Assessment Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation (Week 1)

1. **Define Scope** — Identify organizational units, systems, and processes in scope
2. **Gather Documentation** — Collect policies, procedures, architecture diagrams, audit reports
3. **Schedule Interviews** — Book time with CISO, IT leadership, security team, business stakeholders
4. **Review Prior Assessments** — Analyze previous CSF assessments, audit findings, penetration test results

### Phase 2: Assessment (Weeks 2-3)

1. **Function-by-Function Evaluation** — Assess each category using the csf_maturity_assessor tool
2. **Evidence Collection** — Gather artifacts supporting each score (screenshots, configs, reports)
3. **Stakeholder Interviews** — Validate documented state against operational reality
4. **Technical Validation** — Verify technical controls through testing (not just documentation)

### Phase 3: Analysis (Week 4)

1. **Score Compilation** — Aggregate scores across all functions and categories
2. **Gap Analysis** — Compare current profile to target profile
3. **Risk Prioritization** — Rank gaps by risk exposure and remediation effort
4. **Cross-Reference** — Map findings to applicable regulatory requirements

### Phase 4: Reporting and Roadmap (Week 5)

1. **Executive Summary** — High-level maturity scores with trend analysis
2. **Detailed Findings** — Category-level findings with evidence and recommendations
3. **Remediation Roadmap** — Phased plan with milestones, owners, and resource requirements
4. **Board Presentation** — Strategic summary suitable for governance bodies

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Maturity assessor output shows all categories at Tier 1 | Input JSON missing score entries or all scores set to default | Verify the input JSON has a `score` field (1-4) for each assessed category. Run with `--functions` to test a subset first. |
| Control mapper produces empty mappings for a target framework | Framework identifier misspelled or unsupported | Use exact identifiers: `iso27001`, `soc2`, `hipaa`, `pci-dss`, or `all`. Check `--source-framework` is set to `nist-csf`. |
| Gap analysis shows no gaps despite immature program | Target tier set too low (e.g., Tier 1) | Increase `--target-tier` to 3 or 4 to reflect a meaningful target state. Tier 1 is "Partial" and almost any control satisfies it. |
| Markdown output formatting broken | Special characters in evidence or notes fields | Ensure evidence text in input JSON does not contain unescaped pipe characters or markdown syntax. Use plain text descriptions. |
| Assessment does not include GOVERN function | Input JSON uses CSF 1.1 structure without GOVERN | GOVERN is new in CSF 2.0. Update the input JSON to include `GOVERN` with categories GV.OC, GV.RM, GV.RR, GV.PO, GV.OV, and GV.SC. |
| Cross-framework mapping missing subcategory detail | Mapper operates at category level, not subcategory | The mapper provides category-to-control mappings. For subcategory-level detail, consult the NIST CSF 2.0 Informative References online catalog. |
| Report file not created | Output path directory does not exist | Create the output directory before running. The tool does not create intermediate directories automatically. |

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- NIST CSF 2.0 maturity assessment across all 6 functions and 22 categories
- Current and target profile creation with gap analysis
- Cross-framework control mapping to ISO 27001:2022, SOC 2 TSC, HIPAA Security Rule, and PCI-DSS v4.0
- Implementation roadmap generation with phased milestones
- Tier-based scoring (Partial, Risk Informed, Repeatable, Adaptive)

**Out of Scope:**
- NIST SP 800-53 control-level implementation (CSF is a framework, not a control catalog; use SP 800-53 for prescriptive controls)
- Technical security testing, vulnerability scanning, or penetration testing (use infrastructure-compliance-auditor)
- Sector-specific Community Profiles (the tool provides organizational profiles; community profiles require sector-specific customization)
- Real-time security monitoring or SIEM configuration
- Compliance certification (NIST CSF is voluntary and does not offer formal certification)
- Legal or regulatory advice on specific compliance obligations

## Integration Points

| Skill | Integration |
|-------|------------|
| [soc2-compliance-expert](../soc2-compliance-expert/) | SOC 2 TSC maps directly to CSF functions; use the control mapper to generate a unified control matrix reducing dual-audit burden |
| [information-security-manager-iso27001](../information-security-manager-iso27001/) | ISO 27001 Annex A controls are the implementation backbone for CSF categories; CSF maturity scores inform ISMS continual improvement |
| [infrastructure-compliance-auditor](../infrastructure-compliance-auditor/) | Validates technical controls (access, encryption, monitoring, endpoints) that underpin PROTECT and DETECT function scores |
| [pci-dss-specialist](../pci-dss-specialist/) | PCI-DSS v4.0 requirements map to CSF categories; use cross-framework mapper for payment environments |
| [nis2-directive-specialist](../nis2-directive-specialist/) | NIS2 Article 21 measures align to CSF functions; CSF maturity assessment benchmarks NIS2 compliance posture |
| [dora-compliance-expert](../dora-compliance-expert/) | DORA ICT risk management pillars map to GOVERN and IDENTIFY functions; use CSF as the unifying assessment framework |
