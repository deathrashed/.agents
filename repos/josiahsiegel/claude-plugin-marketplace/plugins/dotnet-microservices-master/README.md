## Based On

This agent's knowledge comes from the official Microsoft guide:
**".NET Microservices Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications"**
- Edition v7.0 (Updated to ASP.NET Core 7.0)
- 350 pages of comprehensive guidance
- Reference application: eShopOnContainers

## Real-World Applications

The agent can help you:

1. **Design new microservices systems** from scratch
2. **Migrate monoliths** to microservices architecture  
3. **Implement DDD patterns** in your domain model
4. **Add resilience** to existing services
5. **Deploy to Kubernetes** with best practices
6. **Troubleshoot** architectural issues
7. **Review** microservices designs

## Best Suited For

- **Architects** designing .NET microservices systems
- **Developers** implementing microservices patterns
- **DevOps engineers** deploying containerized apps
- **Technical leads** making architecture decisions
- **Teams** adopting microservices architecture

## Not a Replacement For

While the agent is highly knowledgeable, it's not a replacement for:
- Reading the full Microsoft guide (highly recommended!)
- Hands-on experience building microservices
- Understanding your specific business requirements
- Proper testing and validation

## Windows & Git Bash Compatibility

This plugin is fully compatible with Windows development environments and Git Bash:

### ✅ Path Handling
- Automatically converts Git Bash paths (`/s/repos/`) to Windows format (`S:\repos\`)
- Handles Docker volume mounts correctly across platforms
- Works seamlessly with .NET CLI in Git Bash

### 🔧 Common Scenarios
- **Creating microservices:** Works with both PowerShell and Git Bash
- **Dockerfile generation:** Handles path formats correctly
- **Docker Compose:** Creates files compatible with Windows Docker Desktop
- **.NET project files:** Manages .csproj and .sln files with proper paths

### 💡 Tip for Git Bash Users
If working in Git Bash on Windows, use `pwd -W` to get Windows-formatted paths that the agent can work with directly.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific** about your scenario and constraints
2. **Mention your tech stack** (Azure, AWS, on-prem)
3. **Ask about trade-offs** to make informed decisions
4. **Request code examples** when you need implementation guidance
5. **Reference eShopOnContainers** for concrete examples
6. **On Windows with Git Bash:** Use `pwd -W` for paths

## Agent Characteristics

The .NET Microservices Expert agent:
- ✅ Provides practical, production-ready guidance
- ✅ Explains trade-offs and when NOT to use patterns
- ✅ References eShopOnContainers for examples
- ✅ Understands Azure services and integration
- ✅ Balances theory with real-world pragmatism
- ✅ Offers code examples in C#
- ❌ Doesn't over-engineer simple problems
- ❌ Doesn't recommend microservices for every scenario
- ❌ Doesn't ignore operational complexity

## Example Interaction

```
You: I need to build an e-commerce platform. Should I use microservices?

Agent: Let me help you think through this decision. First, consider:

1. **Team size:** Do you have multiple teams that could own separate services?
2. **Complexity:** Does your domain have distinct bounded contexts (catalog, ordering, 
   payment, shipping)?
3. **Scale requirements:** Do different parts need to scale independently?
4. **Deployment needs:** Do you need to deploy features independently?

For e-commerce, microservices can work well because you naturally have boundaries 
like Catalog, Ordering, Basket, Payment, and Identity. However, if you're a small 
team (<10 developers), I'd recommend starting with a modular monolith using clean 
boundaries, then extracting microservices as you grow.

Want me to walk through how eShopOnContainers structures its microservices for 
e-commerce?
