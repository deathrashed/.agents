## Installation

### Via GitHub Marketplace (Recommended)

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add JosiahSiegel/claude-plugin-marketplace

# Install salesforce-master
/plugin install salesforce-master@claude-plugin-marketplace
```

### Local Installation (Mac/Linux)

⚠️ **Windows users:** Use marketplace installation method instead.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JosiahSiegel/claude-plugin-marketplace.git

# Copy plugin to Claude Code plugins directory
cp -r claude-plugin-marketplace/plugins/salesforce-master ~/.local/share/claude/plugins/
```

## Windows & Git Bash Compatibility

This plugin provides comprehensive guidance for **Windows Git Bash/MINGW environments**, which are commonly used for Salesforce CLI development on Windows.

### Key Features for Windows Developers

**Path Conversion Handling**: Automatic path conversion in Git Bash can cause issues with Salesforce CLI commands. The plugin includes:
- Shell detection patterns ($MSYSTEM, uname -s)
- MSYS_NO_PATHCONV usage for disabling path conversion
- Cross-platform deployment script examples
- cygpath usage for manual path conversion

**SF CLI Best Practices**: Windows-specific guidance for:
- `sf project deploy start` with proper path handling
- `sf project retrieve start` with manifest files
- CI/CD pipelines on Windows runners
- Relative vs absolute path strategies

**Cross-Platform Integration**: Node.js integration code with:
- path.resolve() for cross-platform compatibility
- Shell environment detection (Git Bash, WSL, PowerShell)
- File system operations that work on all platforms

**Affected Commands**: Windows path guidance is integrated into:
- `/sf-deploy` - Deployment with Git Bash path handling
- `/sf-integrate` - Integration scripts with shell detection
- All commands include cross-platform examples
