# Self-Improving Agent - Autonomous Learning Patterns

**Tier:** POWERFUL
**Category:** Engineering
**Tags:** self-improvement, AI agents, feedback loops, auto-memory, meta-learning, performance tracking

## Overview

Self-Improving Agent provides architectural patterns for AI agents that get better with use. Most agents are stateless -- they make the same mistakes repeatedly because they lack mechanisms to learn from their own execution. This skill addresses that gap with concrete patterns for feedback capture, memory curation, skill extraction, and regression detection.

The key insight: auto-memory captures everything, but curation is what turns noise into knowledge.

## Sub-Skills

This skill uses compound sub-skill architecture. Each sub-skill in `skills/` handles a specific step of the improvement loop:

| Sub-Skill | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Remember** | `skills/remember.md` | Capture errors and learnings from current session |
| **Extract** | `skills/extract.md` | Extract reusable patterns from completed work |
| **Promote** | `skills/promote.md` | Graduate proven patterns to permanent rules |
| **Review** | `skills/review.md` | Audit memory health, prune stale entries |
| **Status** | `skills/status.md` | Dashboard showing memory state and learning progress |

### Sub-Skill Flow

```
Remember ──> Extract ──> Promote ──> Review
    ^                                  │
    └──────────── Status ◄─────────────┘
```

**The improvement cycle:** Remember captures events during work, Extract identifies patterns across sessions, Promote graduates proven patterns to rules, Review maintains memory health, and Status provides visibility into the entire system.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/pattern_extractor.py` | Extract reusable patterns from session logs |
| `scripts/memory_health_checker.py` | Audit memory for stale, duplicate, and promotable entries |
| `scripts/rule_promoter.py` | Validate and apply promotions from memory to rules |
| `scripts/feedback_analyzer.py` | Analyze feedback logs for success rates and opportunities |
| `scripts/regression_detector.py` | Compare baseline vs current performance metrics |
| `scripts/rule_manager.py` | Manage a learned rules knowledge base with CRUD |

```

### Improvement Maturity Levels

| Level | Name | Mechanism | Example |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|
| 0 | Stateless | No memory between sessions | Default agent behavior |
| 1 | Recording | Captures observations, no action | Auto-memory logging |
| 2 | Curating | Organizes and deduplicates observations | Memory review + cleanup |
| 3 | Promoting | Graduates patterns to enforced rules | MEMORY.md entries become CLAUDE.md rules |
| 4 | Extracting | Creates reusable skills from proven patterns | Recurring solutions become skill packages |
| 5 | Meta-Learning | Adapts learning strategy itself | Adjusts what to capture based on what proved useful |

Most agents operate at Level 0-1. This skill provides the machinery for Levels 2-5.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Memory Curation System

#### The Memory Stack

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CLAUDE.md / .claude/rules/                      │
│  Highest authority. Enforced every session.       │
│  Capacity: Unlimited. Load: Full file.           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  MEMORY.md (auto-memory)                         │
│  Project learnings. Auto-captured by Claude.     │
│  Capacity: First 200 lines loaded. Overflow to   │
│  topic files.                                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Session Context                                  │
│  Current conversation. Ephemeral.                │
│  Capacity: Context window.                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Memory Review Protocol

Run periodically (weekly or after every 10 sessions):

```
Step 1: Read MEMORY.md and all topic files
Step 2: Classify each entry

  Categories:
  - PROMOTE: Pattern proven 3+ times, should be a rule
  - CONSOLIDATE: Multiple entries saying the same thing
  - STALE: References deleted files, old patterns, resolved issues
  - KEEP: Still relevant, not yet proven enough to promote
  - EXTRACT: Recurring solution that should be a reusable skill

Step 3: Execute actions
  - PROMOTE entries → move to CLAUDE.md or .claude/rules/
  - CONSOLIDATE entries → merge into single clear entry
  - STALE entries → delete
  - EXTRACT entries → create skill package (see Skill Extraction)

Step 4: Verify MEMORY.md is under 200 lines
  - If over 200: move topic-specific entries to topic files
  - Topic files: ~/.claude/projects/<path>/memory/<topic>.md
```

#### Promotion Criteria

An entry is ready for promotion when:

| Criterion | Threshold | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Recurrence | Seen in 3+ sessions | Not a one-off |
| Consistency | Same solution every time | Not context-dependent |
| Impact | Prevented errors or saved significant time | Worth enforcing |
| Stability | Underlying code/system unchanged | Won't immediately become stale |
| Clarity | Can be stated in 1-2 sentences | Rules must be unambiguous |

#### Promotion Targets

| Pattern Type | Promote To | Example |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Coding convention | `.claude/rules/<area>.md` | "Always use `type` not `interface` for object shapes" |
| Project architecture | `CLAUDE.md` | "All API routes go through middleware chain" |
| Tool preference | `CLAUDE.md` | "Use pnpm, not npm" |
| Debugging pattern | `.claude/rules/debugging.md` | "When tests fail, check env vars first" |
| File-scoped rule | `.claude/rules/<scope>.md` with `paths:` | "In migrations/, always add down migration" |

### 2. Feedback Loop Design

#### Outcome Classification

Every agent task produces an outcome. Classify it:

```
SUCCESS         - Task completed, user accepted result
PARTIAL         - Task completed but required corrections
FAILURE         - Task failed, user had to redo
REJECTION       - User explicitly rejected approach
TIMEOUT         - Task exceeded time/token budget
ERROR           - Technical error (tool failure, API error)
```

#### Signal Extraction from Outcomes

| Outcome | Signal | Memory Action |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| SUCCESS (first try) | Approach works well | Reinforce (increment confidence) |
| SUCCESS (after correction) | Initial approach had gap | Log the correction pattern |
| PARTIAL (user edited result) | Output format or content gap | Log what user changed |
| FAILURE | Approach fundamentally wrong | Log anti-pattern with context |
| REJECTION | Misunderstood requirements | Log clarification pattern |
| Repeated ERROR | Tool or environment issue | Log workaround or fix |

#### Feedback Capture Template

```markdown
## Learning: [Short description]

**Context:** [What task was being performed]
**What happened:** [Outcome description]
**Root cause:** [Why the outcome occurred]
**Correct approach:** [What should have been done]
**Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Recurrence:** [First time / Seen N times]
**Action:** [KEEP / PROMOTE / EXTRACT]
```

### 3. Performance Regression Detection

#### Metrics to Track

| Metric | Measurement | Regression Signal |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| First-attempt success rate | Tasks accepted without correction | Dropping below 70% |
| Correction count per task | User edits after agent output | Rising above 2 per task |
| Tool error rate | Failed tool calls / total calls | Rising above 5% |
| Context relevance | Retrieved context actually used | Dropping below 60% |
| Task completion time | Turns to complete task | Rising trend over 5 sessions |

#### Regression Response Protocol

```
1. DETECT: Metric crosses threshold
2. DIAGNOSE: Compare recent sessions vs baseline
   - What changed? (New code? New patterns? New tools?)
   - Which task types are affected?
   - Is it a memory issue or a capability issue?
3. RESPOND:
   - Memory issue → Review and curate MEMORY.md
   - Stale rules → Update CLAUDE.md
   - New code patterns → Add rules for new patterns
   - Capability gap → Extract as skill request
4. VERIFY: Track metric for next 3 sessions
```

### 4. Skill Extraction

When a solution pattern is proven and reusable, extract it into a standalone skill.

#### Extraction Criteria

```
A pattern is ready for extraction when:
- Used successfully 5+ times across different contexts
- Solution is generalizable (not project-specific)
- Takes more than trivial effort to recreate from scratch
- Would benefit other projects/users
```

#### Extraction Process

```
Step 1: Document the pattern
  - What problem does it solve?
  - What's the step-by-step approach?
  - What are the inputs and outputs?
  - What are the edge cases?

Step 2: Generalize
  - Remove project-specific details
  - Identify configurable parameters
  - Add handling for common variations

Step 3: Package as skill
  - Create SKILL.md with frontmatter
  - Add references/ for knowledge bases
  - Add scripts/ if automatable
  - Add assets/ for templates

Step 4: Validate
  - Test on a different project
  - Have another person/agent use it
  - Iterate on unclear instructions
```

### 5. Meta-Learning Patterns

#### Adaptive Capture Strategy

Not all observations are equally valuable. Adjust what gets captured based on what proved useful:

```
Initial strategy: Capture everything
After 10 sessions: Analyze which captured items led to promotions
After 20 sessions: Adjust capture to focus on high-value categories

High-value categories (typically):
  - Error resolutions (80% promotion rate)
  - User corrections (70% promotion rate)
  - Tool preferences (60% promotion rate)

Low-value categories (typically):
  - File structure observations (10% promotion rate)
  - One-off workarounds (5% promotion rate)
```

#### Anti-Pattern Detection

Beyond capturing what works, actively detect what fails:

| Anti-Pattern | Detection Signal | Response |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| Repeated wrong import path | Same correction 3+ times | Add to CLAUDE.md as rule |
| Wrong test framework used | User always changes test approach | Add testing rules |
| Incorrect API usage | Same API error pattern | Add API usage notes |
| Style guide violations | User reformats same patterns | Add style rules |
| Wrong branch workflow | User corrects git operations | Add git workflow rules |

### 6. Continuous Calibration

#### Confidence Scoring

Every piece of learned knowledge carries a confidence score:

```
Confidence = base_score * recency_factor * consistency_factor

base_score:
  - User explicitly stated: 1.0
  - Observed from successful outcome: 0.8
  - Inferred from pattern: 0.6
  - Guessed from context: 0.3

recency_factor:
  - Last 7 days: 1.0
  - 7-30 days: 0.9
  - 30-90 days: 0.7
  - 90+ days: 0.5

consistency_factor:
  - Never contradicted: 1.0
  - Contradicted once, reaffirmed: 0.9
  - Contradicted, not reaffirmed: 0.5
  - Actively contradicted: 0.0 (delete)
```

#### Belief Revision

When new information contradicts existing knowledge:

```
1. Compare confidence scores
2. If new info higher confidence → update knowledge
3. If roughly equal → flag for user confirmation
4. If new info lower confidence → keep existing, note conflict
5. Always log the conflict for review
```

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Weekly Memory Health Check

```
1. Read all memory files (MEMORY.md + topic files)
2. Count total entries and lines
3. For each entry, classify: PROMOTE / CONSOLIDATE / STALE / KEEP / EXTRACT
4. Execute promotions (with user confirmation)
5. Execute consolidations
6. Delete stale entries
7. Verify under 200-line limit
8. Report: entries promoted, consolidated, deleted, remaining
```

### Workflow 2: Post-Session Learning Capture

```
1. Review session outcomes (successes, corrections, failures)
2. For each correction: log what was wrong and what was right
3. For each failure: log root cause and correct approach
4. Check existing memory for related entries
5. If related entry exists: increment recurrence count
6. If new: add entry with context
7. If recurrence threshold met: flag for promotion
```

### Workflow 3: Regression Investigation

```
1. Identify the degraded metric
2. Pull last 5 sessions' outcomes for that task type
3. Compare against baseline (first 5 sessions)
4. Identify what changed: memory, code, rules, environment
5. Propose fix: update rule, add rule, retrain pattern
6. Apply fix
7. Monitor next 3 sessions
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Memory bloat | Auto-capture without curation | Weekly review, enforce 200-line limit |
| Stale rules | Code changes, rules don't update | Timestamp rules, periodic re-verification |
| Over-promotion | Promoting one-off patterns as rules | Require 3+ recurrences before promotion |
| Silent regression | No metrics tracking | Implement outcome classification |
| Cargo cult rules | Copying rules without understanding | Each rule must have a "why" annotation |
| Contradiction spirals | New rules conflict with old rules | Belief revision protocol |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| MEMORY.md exceeds 200 lines and keeps growing | Auto-capture enabled without scheduled curation | Run the Weekly Memory Health Check workflow; split topic-specific entries into `memory/<topic>.md` files |
| Promoted rules contradict each other | Two conflicting patterns both crossed the 3-recurrence threshold | Apply the Belief Revision protocol -- compare confidence scores, resolve the conflict, delete the weaker rule |
| Agent performance degrades after a promotion batch | Newly promoted rules interact badly or are overly prescriptive | Roll back the most recent promotions, re-validate each rule in isolation, and promote incrementally |
| Skill extraction produces a package that only works on the original project | Generalization step was skipped or rushed | Revisit Extraction Process Step 2 -- strip project-specific details, parameterize hardcoded values, test on a second project before packaging |
| Feedback loop captures noise (trivial observations dominate) | Capture strategy has not been calibrated with the Adaptive Capture Strategy | After 10 sessions, analyze promotion rates by category and restrict capture to high-value categories (error resolutions, user corrections, tool preferences) |
| Regression Detection flags false positives | Thresholds set too aggressively for early-stage projects | Widen thresholds during the first 20 sessions (e.g., first-attempt success 60% instead of 70%), then tighten once a stable baseline exists |
| Confidence scores decay too fast on valid long-term rules | Recency factor penalizes rules that are infrequently encountered but still correct | For rules explicitly confirmed by the user, override the recency factor to 1.0 regardless of age |

## Success Criteria

- **First-attempt success rate above 80%** after 20 sessions of active self-improvement, measured as tasks accepted without user correction.
- **Memory size stays under 200 lines** in MEMORY.md at all times, with overflow correctly routed to topic files.
- **Promotion rate of 15-25%** of captured observations within 30 days, indicating the capture strategy targets high-value signals.
- **Zero stale rules** remaining after each Weekly Memory Health Check -- every rule references current code, tools, and workflows.
- **Regression detection latency under 3 sessions** -- performance degradation is flagged within 3 sessions of onset, not discovered weeks later.
- **Extracted skills reusable across 2+ projects** without modification, validating that the generalization step produces genuinely portable packages.
- **Contradiction resolution within 1 session** -- conflicting rules are detected and resolved via the Belief Revision protocol before they cause downstream errors.

## Scope & Limitations

**This skill covers:**
- Architectural patterns for building agents that learn from execution history and user feedback.
- Memory lifecycle management: capture, curation, promotion, and retirement of learned knowledge.
- Performance regression detection frameworks and response protocols for agent systems.
- Skill extraction methodology for graduating proven patterns into reusable, standalone packages.

**This skill does NOT cover:**
- Runtime agent orchestration or multi-agent coordination -- see `agent-workflow-designer` and `agent-protocol` for those patterns.
- Prompt engineering, testing, or versioning of the prompts themselves -- see `prompt-engineer-toolkit` for prompt lifecycle management.
- Infrastructure-level observability (logging, tracing, alerting dashboards) -- see `observability-designer` for system-level monitoring.
- Initial agent architecture design, tool selection, or capability planning -- see `agent-designer` for foundational agent design decisions.

## Integration Points

| Skill | Integration | Data Flow |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **context-engine** | Context Engine controls what the agent sees per session; Self-Improving Agent decides what is worth remembering long-term | Promoted rules and curated memory flow into context retrieval; context relevance metrics flow back for regression tracking |
| **agent-designer** | Agent Designer defines the agent's architecture and capabilities; Self-Improving Agent layers learning infrastructure on top | Architecture constraints inform what feedback loops are possible; extracted skills feed back as new agent capabilities |
| **prompt-engineer-toolkit** | Prompts degrade over time as codebases evolve; Self-Improving Agent detects prompt regression via outcome tracking | Performance metrics flag underperforming prompts; prompt updates feed back as rule changes in CLAUDE.md |
| **observability-designer** | Observability provides system-level metrics; Self-Improving Agent provides agent-behavior-level metrics | System telemetry enriches regression diagnosis; agent performance metrics can be exported to observability dashboards |
| **tech-debt-tracker** | Stale rules and bloated memory are a form of technical debt; Tech Debt Tracker can surface them alongside code debt | Memory health metrics feed into debt scoring; debt prioritization informs which stale rules to retire first |
| **agent-workflow-designer** | Multi-step agent workflows benefit from per-step feedback capture and cross-workflow pattern extraction | Per-step outcome data flows into feedback loops; extracted workflow optimizations flow back as updated workflow definitions |
