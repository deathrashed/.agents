## Skill Package Structure

Every skill follows the same structure:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md        # Master documentation and workflows
├── scripts/        # Python CLI tools (standard library only)
├── references/     # Expert knowledge bases
└── assets/         # User templates
```

**Design philosophy:** Skills are self-contained packages. Each includes executable tools (Python scripts), knowledge bases (markdown references), and user-facing templates. Extract a skill folder and use it immediately.

## How to Use a Skill

1. **Read the SKILL.md** -- Contains workflows, best practices, and when to use it
2. **Run the scripts** -- `python skill-name/scripts/tool.py [args]` for automated analysis
3. **Reference the knowledge** -- `references/` contains expert-curated frameworks
4. **Apply templates** -- `assets/` has ready-to-customize deliverable templates
