## Skills 🛠️

### AGENTS.md Generator

**Directory:** `agents-md-generator/`

**Description:** Create or update minimal AGENTS.md files in the repository root and nested module directories using progressive disclosure. Works across heterogeneous projects without assuming any fixed agent folder structure.

**When to use:**

- AGENTS.md is missing, bloated, contradictory, or outdated
- A new package/service/module appears
- Repository structure changes (monorepo growth or split)
- Teams want consistent agent context across diverse stacks

**Key capabilities:**

- Discover repository shape (git root, language/tool markers)
- Detect module boundaries (build manifests, deployable units)
- Generate root AGENTS.md (≤60 lines): purpose, toolchain, commands, docs links
- Generate nested AGENTS.md (≤40 lines): module purpose, local commands
- Progressive disclosure: keep AGENTS.md concise, link to docs/skills
- Adaptive skill referencing (local or external)

**Output:**

- `<repo_root>/AGENTS.md`
- `<module_dir>/AGENTS.md` (for independent packages/services)

**References:**

- `AGENTS_TEMPLATE_ROOT.md` — Root AGENTS.md template
