# Concise Planning

Turn a user request into a single, actionable plan with atomic steps.

## Workflow

### 1. Scan Context

- Read README, docs, and relevant code files.
- Identify constraints (language, frameworks, tests).

### 2. Minimal Interaction

- Ask at most 1–2 questions, only if truly blocking.
- Make reasonable assumptions for non-blocking unknowns.

### 3. Generate Plan

Use the following structure:

- **Approach**: 1–3 sentences on what and why.
- **Scope**: Bullet points for "In" and "Out".
- **Action Items**: 6–10 atomic, ordered tasks (verb-first).
- **Validation**: At least one item for testing.

## Plan Template

```
# Plan

<High-level approach>

## Scope

- In:
- Out:

## Action Items

[ ] <Step 1: Discovery>
[ ] <Step 2: Implementation>
[ ] <Step 3: Implementation>
[ ] <Step 4: Validation>
[ ] <Step 5: Rollout>

## Open Questions

- <Question 1 (max 3)>
```

## Checklist Guidelines

- **Atomic**: Each step is a single logical unit of work.
- **Verb-first**: "Add...", "Refactor...", "Verify...".
- **Concrete**: Name specific files or modules when possible.
