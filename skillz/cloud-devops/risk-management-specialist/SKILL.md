1. Calculate initial risk level from probability × severity
2. Compare to risk acceptability criteria
3. For each risk, determine:
   - Acceptable: Document and accept
   - ALARP: Proceed to risk control
   - Unacceptable: Mandatory risk control
4. Document evaluation rationale
5. Identify risks requiring benefit-risk analysis
6. Complete benefit-risk analysis if applicable
7. Compile risk evaluation summary
8. **Validation:** All risks evaluated; acceptability determined; rationale documented

### Risk Evaluation Decision Tree

```

## AI-Specific Risk Management (ISO 14971 + AI Risk Considerations)

### AI/ML Medical Device Risk Categories

Traditional ISO 14971 hazard categories must be extended for AI/ML-based devices:

| AI-Specific Hazard | Description | Severity Potential | Detection Difficulty |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Model bias | Discriminatory outputs across patient subgroups | S3-S5 (misdiagnosis) | High — requires subgroup analysis |
| Data drift | Input data distribution shifts from training data | S2-S4 (degraded performance) | Medium — requires monitoring |
| Concept drift | Clinical ground truth changes over time | S3-S5 (outdated predictions) | High — requires clinical validation |
| Adversarial inputs | Intentionally crafted inputs to deceive model | S2-S5 (incorrect output) | High — requires adversarial testing |
| Hallucination/confabulation | Plausible but incorrect outputs | S3-S5 (false diagnosis) | Medium — requires output validation |
| Training data poisoning | Corrupted training data leads to systematic errors | S3-S5 | Very High — requires data provenance |
| Automation complacency | Users over-trust AI outputs | S3-S5 (missed clinical findings) | Medium — requires human factors study |

### AI Risk Analysis Methodology

```
Step 1: AI System Characterization
        → Define intended use, user population, clinical context
        → Classify: locked algorithm vs. adaptive vs. continuously learning
        → Map to SaMD risk framework (IMDRF)

Step 2: AI-Specific Hazard Identification
        → Apply standard ISO 14971 hazard categories
        → ADD: data quality hazards, algorithmic hazards, integration hazards
        → Consider: training data representativeness, edge cases, failure modes

Step 3: AI Failure Mode Analysis
        → Extend FMEA with AI-specific failure modes:
           - False positive/negative beyond acceptable rates
           - Performance degradation over time
           - Out-of-distribution input handling
           - Feature importance shift
        → For each failure mode: determine harm pathway to patient

Step 4: AI-Specific Risk Controls
        → Confidence thresholds (reject uncertain predictions)
        → Human-in-the-loop for high-risk decisions
        → Input validation and out-of-distribution detection
        → Continuous performance monitoring with drift detection
        → Automated model retraining safeguards
        → Fail-safe modes when AI system is unavailable

Step 5: AI Risk Monitoring Plan
        → Define performance metrics and acceptable thresholds
        → Establish monitoring frequency (real-time, daily, weekly)
        → Define retraining triggers and validation requirements
        → Plan for model versioning and rollback procedures
```

### AI Risk Acceptability Considerations

| Risk Factor | Additional Consideration for AI |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Probability | Include statistical confidence intervals for model performance |
| Severity | Consider both direct harm and harm from delayed correct treatment |
| Detectability | Factor in opacity of AI decision-making (explainability) |
| Benefit | Quantify clinical benefit vs. non-AI alternative |
| ALARP | State-of-the-art includes current AI best practices (GMLP) |

## Supply Chain Risk Management

### Medical Device Supply Chain Risks

| Risk Category | Description | Probability | Impact | Control Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| Single-source component | Critical component from sole supplier | Medium | Critical | Dual-source qualification, safety stock |
| Counterfeit components | Fraudulent parts entering supply chain | Low-Medium | Catastrophic | Supplier audits, incoming inspection, chain of custody |
| Supplier quality failure | Supplier QMS breakdown | Medium | High | Supplier qualification, periodic audits, quality agreements |
| Software dependency | Vulnerable or unsupported open-source library | High | Medium-High | SBOM management, vulnerability scanning, update policy |
| Geopolitical disruption | Sanctions, trade restrictions, supply interruption | Low-Medium | High | Geographic diversification, buffer inventory |
| Raw material shortage | Rare earth, specialty materials unavailability | Low | High | Alternative material qualification, forward contracts |

### Supply Chain Risk Assessment Workflow

```
Step 1: Supply Chain Mapping
        → Identify all direct suppliers (Tier 1)
        → Map critical Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers
        → Document component criticality (safety-critical, quality-critical, standard)

Step 2: Supplier Risk Scoring
        → Quality risk: past performance, certification status, audit results
        → Financial risk: stability, dependency on your business
        → Geographic risk: natural disaster, political stability
        → Cyber risk: supplier's information security posture
        → Concentration risk: single-source, regional concentration

Step 3: Risk Treatment
        → Critical suppliers: quality agreements, annual audits, dual-sourcing
        → High-risk suppliers: enhanced monitoring, contingency plans
        → Medium-risk suppliers: periodic review, performance metrics
        → Low-risk suppliers: standard purchasing controls

Step 4: Ongoing Monitoring
        → Supplier scorecard tracking (quality, delivery, responsiveness)
        → Annual supplier risk reassessment
        → Trigger-based reassessment (quality event, financial change, M&A)
```

    → Classify by hazard category (auto or manual)
    → Check: Known hazard?
        YES → Update frequency data → Recalculate risk level
                → Risk level changed? → Flag for risk management review
        NO  → New hazard identified → Initiate risk analysis
              → Estimate initial risk → Determine controls needed
              → Update risk management file

Trend threshold exceeded
    → Generate trend report with statistical analysis
    → Convene risk management review within 30 days
    → Update risk management file with new probability estimates
    → Evaluate if additional risk controls needed
    → If safety issue: initiate FSCA/field action assessment

## Enhanced Risk Management — AI, Cybersecurity & Cross-Framework Integration

### AI-Specific Risk Management

When managing risk for AI/ML medical devices, extend ISO 14971 with:

- **AI Model Risk:** Training data bias, model drift, adversarial attacks, explainability gaps
- **Performance Degradation:** Monitor for distribution shift, concept drift, and data quality issues
- **Algorithmic Bias:** Demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration across subgroups
- **Human-AI Interaction Risks:** Over-reliance, automation bias, alert fatigue, trust calibration
- **Cross-reference:** See `eu-ai-act-specialist` for EU AI Act risk classification

### Cybersecurity Risk Integration (IEC 81001-5-1)

- **Health Software Cybersecurity:** IEC 81001-5-1 extends ISO 14971 for cybersecurity
- **Threat Modeling:** STRIDE methodology applied to medical device architecture
- **Cybersecurity FMEA:** Failure modes include unauthorized access, data breach, ransomware, supply chain attack
- **Vulnerability Management:** CVSS scoring integrated with ISO 14971 severity/probability matrix
- **Cross-reference:** See `infrastructure-compliance-auditor` for technical security checks

### Supply Chain Risk Management

- **Component Risk:** Third-party software vulnerabilities (SBOM-based assessment)
- **Supplier Risk:** Single-source dependencies, geopolitical risks, quality history
- **Cloud Risk:** Data residency, service availability, vendor lock-in
- **Cross-reference:** See `nis2-directive-specialist` for NIS2 supply chain requirements

### Cross-Framework Risk Mapping

| Risk Area | ISO 14971 | NIST CSF 2.0 | DORA | NIS2 |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------|------|
| Risk Assessment | Clause 4 | ID.RA | Art. 6 | Art. 21.1 |
| Risk Treatment | Clause 7 | PR (all) | Art. 9 | Art. 21.2 |
| Monitoring | Clause 9 | DE.CM | Art. 10 | Art. 21.2.f |
| Incident Response | Clause 9 | RS.MA | Art. 17 | Art. 23 |
| Continuous Improvement | Clause 10 | ID.IM | Art. 13 | Art. 21.2.f |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Risk matrix calculator returns "Invalid probability" | Probability value outside 1-5 range | Use integers 1-5 for probability (`--probability`) and 1-5 for severity (`--severity`). Run `--list-criteria` to display the full scale definitions. |
| FMEA RPN calculation produces unexpected results | Severity, occurrence, or detection values outside 1-10 range | FMEA mode (`--fmea`) requires `--severity`, `--occurrence`, and `--detection` values each in the 1-10 range. Values outside this range produce unreliable RPNs. |
| Risk level shows "Medium" but stakeholders expect "High" | Risk acceptability criteria differ from the tool's default 5x5 matrix | The default matrix follows common ISO 14971 practice. If your organization uses a custom risk matrix, adjust the risk acceptability criteria in your Risk Management Plan and document deviations. |
| Post-production risk data not triggering file updates | Review triggers not defined or too narrow | Define explicit triggers: any serious incident (immediate), new hazard identification (30 days), trend increase (60 days), design change (before implementation), and standards update (per transition period). |
| AI-specific hazards not captured in FMEA | Standard FMEA template lacks AI failure modes | Extend the FMEA with AI-specific failure modes: model bias, data drift, concept drift, adversarial inputs, automation complacency. Use the AI Risk Analysis Methodology section as a guide. |
| Cybersecurity threats not integrated into risk assessment | Threat modeling methodology not aligned to ISO 14971 | Use STRIDE methodology for threat identification, then map each threat to an ISO 14971 harm pathway. Reference IEC 81001-5-1 for health software cybersecurity integration. |
| Benefit-risk analysis requested but no template available | The tool calculates risk levels but does not generate benefit-risk documents | The benefit-risk analysis is a narrative document per ISO 14971 Clause 8. Use the risk matrix outputs as quantitative inputs, then document clinical benefits vs. residual risks in the Risk Management Report. |

## Success Criteria

- Risk Management Plan approved with defined scope, risk acceptability matrix, RACI chart, and post-production monitoring plan before design input phase
- 100% of ISO 14971 hazard categories analyzed (electrical, mechanical, thermal, radiation, biological, chemical, software, use error, environmental) with documented rationale for each
- All identified risks evaluated against the 5x5 acceptability matrix with no uncontrolled "Unacceptable" residual risks remaining
- Risk controls implemented following the priority hierarchy (inherent safety first, then protective measures, then information for safety) with verification records for every control
- Overall residual risk evaluated as acceptable or ALARP demonstrated, with benefit-risk analysis completed for any residual risks remaining in High territory
- Post-production risk monitoring operational with defined information sources, review triggers, and a documented process for updating the Risk Management File
- For AI/ML devices: AI-specific risk categories (bias, drift, adversarial inputs) assessed per BS/AAMI 34971:2023 or equivalent, with continuous performance monitoring thresholds defined

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- ISO 14971:2019 risk management process implementation (planning, analysis, evaluation, control, residual risk, production/post-production)
- 5x5 risk matrix calculation and FMEA RPN scoring
- Hazard analysis methodology guidance (FMEA, FTA, HAZOP, Use Error Analysis, PHA)
- Risk control hierarchy application and verification planning
- Benefit-risk analysis framework
- Post-production risk monitoring and risk file update triggers
- AI/ML-specific risk management extensions (model bias, drift, adversarial inputs)
- Cybersecurity risk integration per IEC 81001-5-1
- Supply chain risk assessment methodology
- Cross-framework risk mapping (ISO 14971, NIST CSF, DORA, NIS2)

**Out of Scope:**
- Clinical investigation design or execution (risk management informs clinical strategy but does not execute studies)
- Software hazard analysis per IEC 62304 (the skill references software risk but detailed software lifecycle management requires IEC 62304 expertise)
- Biocompatibility testing or ISO 10993 evaluation (the skill identifies biological hazards but does not execute biocompatibility testing)
- Cybersecurity penetration testing or vulnerability scanning (use infrastructure-compliance-auditor for technical security testing)
- CAPA root cause analysis execution (use capa-officer for 5-Why, Fishbone, FTA, FMEA-based root cause investigation)
- Regulatory submission of risk management files (use regulatory-affairs-head for submission strategy and packaging)
