# Senior SecOps Engineer

The agent scans source code for security vulnerabilities (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS, command injection), assesses dependency CVEs across npm/Python/Go ecosystems, and verifies compliance against SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR frameworks.

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Security Scanner

Scan source code for security vulnerabilities including hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS, command injection, and path traversal.

```bash
# Scan project for security issues
python scripts/security_scanner.py /path/to/project

# Filter by severity
python scripts/security_scanner.py /path/to/project --severity high

# JSON output for CI/CD
python scripts/security_scanner.py /path/to/project --json --output report.json
```

**Detects:**
- Hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, AWS credentials, GitHub tokens, private keys)
- SQL injection patterns (string concatenation, f-strings, template literals)
- XSS vulnerabilities (innerHTML assignment, unsafe DOM manipulation, React unsafe patterns)
- Command injection (shell=True, exec, eval with user input)
- Path traversal (file operations with user input)

### 2. Vulnerability Assessor

Scan dependencies for known CVEs across npm, Python, and Go ecosystems.

```bash
# Assess project dependencies
python scripts/vulnerability_assessor.py /path/to/project

# Critical/high only
python scripts/vulnerability_assessor.py /path/to/project --severity high

# Export vulnerability report
python scripts/vulnerability_assessor.py /path/to/project --json --output vulns.json
```

**Scans:**
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (npm)
- `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` (Python)
- `go.mod` (Go)

**Output:**
- CVE IDs with CVSS scores
- Affected package versions
- Fixed versions for remediation
- Overall risk score (0-100)

### 3. Compliance Checker

Verify security compliance against SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR frameworks.

```bash
# Check all frameworks
python scripts/compliance_checker.py /path/to/project

# Specific framework
python scripts/compliance_checker.py /path/to/project --framework soc2
python scripts/compliance_checker.py /path/to/project --framework pci-dss
python scripts/compliance_checker.py /path/to/project --framework hipaa
python scripts/compliance_checker.py /path/to/project --framework gdpr

# Export compliance report
python scripts/compliance_checker.py /path/to/project --json --output compliance.json
```

**Verifies:**
- Access control implementation
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging
- Authentication strength (MFA, password hashing)
- Security documentation
- CI/CD security controls

---

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Security Audit

Complete security assessment of a codebase.

```bash
# Step 1: Scan for code vulnerabilities
python scripts/security_scanner.py . --severity medium

# Step 2: Check dependency vulnerabilities
python scripts/vulnerability_assessor.py . --severity high

# Step 3: Verify compliance controls
python scripts/compliance_checker.py . --framework all

# Step 4: Generate combined report
python scripts/security_scanner.py . --json --output security.json
python scripts/vulnerability_assessor.py . --json --output vulns.json
python scripts/compliance_checker.py . --json --output compliance.json
```

### Workflow 2: CI/CD Security Gate

Integrate security checks into deployment pipeline.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security Scan

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Security Scanner
        run: python scripts/security_scanner.py . --severity high

      - name: Vulnerability Assessment
        run: python scripts/vulnerability_assessor.py . --severity critical

      - name: Compliance Check
        run: python scripts/compliance_checker.py . --framework soc2
```

### Workflow 3: CVE Triage

Respond to a new CVE affecting your application.

```
1. ASSESS (0-2 hours)
   - Identify affected systems using vulnerability_assessor.py
   - Check if CVE is being actively exploited
   - Determine CVSS environmental score for your context

2. PRIORITIZE
   - Critical (CVSS 9.0+, internet-facing): 24 hours
   - High (CVSS 7.0-8.9): 7 days
   - Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9): 30 days
   - Low (CVSS < 4.0): 90 days

3. REMEDIATE
   - Update affected dependency to fixed version
   - Run security_scanner.py to verify fix
   - Test for regressions
   - Deploy with enhanced monitoring

4. VERIFY
   - Re-run vulnerability_assessor.py
   - Confirm CVE no longer reported
   - Document remediation actions
```

### Workflow 4: Incident Response

Security incident handling procedure.

```
PHASE 1: DETECT & IDENTIFY (0-15 min)
- Alert received and acknowledged
- Initial severity assessment (SEV-1 to SEV-4)
- Incident commander assigned
- Communication channel established

PHASE 2: CONTAIN (15-60 min)
- Affected systems identified
- Network isolation if needed
- Credentials rotated if compromised
- Preserve evidence (logs, memory dumps)

PHASE 3: ERADICATE (1-4 hours)
- Root cause identified
- Malware/backdoors removed
- Vulnerabilities patched (run security_scanner.py)
- Systems hardened

PHASE 4: RECOVER (4-24 hours)
- Systems restored from clean backup
- Services brought back online
- Enhanced monitoring enabled
- User access restored

PHASE 5: POST-INCIDENT (24-72 hours)
- Incident timeline documented
- Root cause analysis complete
- Lessons learned documented
- Preventive measures implemented
- Stakeholder report delivered
```

| **A02: Cryptographic Failures** | Use TLS 1.2+, AES-256 encryption, secure key management |
| **A03: Injection** | Parameterized queries, input validation, escape output |
| **A04: Insecure Design** | Threat modeling, secure design patterns, defense in depth |
| **A05: Security Misconfiguration** | Hardening guides, remove defaults, disable unused features |
| **A06: Vulnerable Components** | Dependency scanning, automated updates, SBOM |
| **A07: Authentication Failures** | MFA, rate limiting, secure password storage |

## Output Encoding
- [ ] HTML encode for browser output
- [ ] URL encode for URLs
- [ ] JavaScript encode for script contexts

## Authentication
- [ ] Use bcrypt/argon2 for passwords
- [ ] Implement MFA for sensitive operations
- [ ] Enforce strong password policy

## Session Management
- [ ] Generate secure random session IDs
- [ ] Set HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite flags
- [ ] Implement session timeout (15 min idle)

## Error Handling
- [ ] Log errors with context (no secrets)
- [ ] Return generic messages to users
- [ ] Never expose stack traces in production

## Secrets Management
- [ ] Use environment variables or secrets manager
- [ ] Never commit secrets to version control
- [ ] Rotate credentials regularly
```

## Best Practices

### Secrets Management

```python
# BAD: Hardcoded secret
API_KEY = "sk-1234567890abcdef"

# GOOD: Environment variable
import os
API_KEY = os.environ.get("API_KEY")

# BETTER: Secrets manager
from your_vault_client import get_secret
API_KEY = get_secret("api/key")
```

### SQL Injection Prevention

```python
# BAD: String concatenation
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# GOOD: Parameterized query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))
```

### XSS Prevention

```javascript
// BAD: Direct innerHTML assignment is vulnerable
// GOOD: Use textContent (auto-escaped)
element.textContent = userInput;

// GOOD: Use sanitization library for HTML
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
const safeHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```

### Authentication

```javascript
// Password hashing
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const SALT_ROUNDS = 12;

// Hash password
const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);

// Verify password
const match = await bcrypt.compare(password, hash);
```

### Security Headers

```javascript
// Express.js security headers
const helmet = require('helmet');
app.use(helmet());

// Or manually set headers:
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
  res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
  res.setHeader('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');
  res.setHeader('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');
  res.setHeader('Content-Security-Policy', "default-src 'self'");
  next();
});
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Relying solely on automated scanning** -- SAST tools miss business logic flaws and authorization issues; combine with manual code review for auth-sensitive code
- **Ignoring medium-severity findings** -- exit code 0 on medium findings does not mean safe; parse JSON output for comprehensive CI gating
- **Hardcoding secrets in test fixtures** -- test files with example tokens trigger false positives; use environment variables or mock values even in tests
- **Compliance score as a goal** -- a 90% compliance score with failed encryption controls is worse than 80% with all critical controls passing; prioritize by severity
- **One-time security audits** -- running the scanner once per quarter misses regressions; integrate into every PR via CI/CD
- **Treating warnings as passed** -- compliance checker scores warnings at 0.5 (partial credit); any control below `passed` needs remediation

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Security scanner reports zero findings on a known-vulnerable project | Test and spec files are excluded by the false-positive filter | Rename the file to remove `test`/`spec` from the path, or review the `_is_false_positive` method |
| Vulnerability assessor misses a CVE for a listed dependency | The package or CVE is not in the built-in `KNOWN_CVES` database | Supplement with an external feed (Snyk, OSV, `npm audit`) and use the assessor for triage prioritization |
| Compliance checker shows `CRITICAL_GAPS` despite controls being present | Pattern-based file search did not match the specific naming convention used in your codebase | Run with `--verbose` to see which checks fail, then verify the matching code patterns or filenames |
| `--json` output is printed to stdout even when `--output` is specified | Both flags are set correctly; this is expected behavior (summary prints to stderr-style console, JSON to file) | Redirect stdout if you need a clean pipe: `python script.py . --json --output report.json > /dev/null` |
| Exit code is 0 despite medium-severity findings | Exit codes only trigger on critical (exit 2) or high (exit 1) severity findings | Use `--severity medium` to surface medium findings in the report, and parse the JSON output for CI/CD gating |
| Scanner is slow on large monorepos | All files matching `SCAN_EXTENSIONS` are read in full | Narrow the target to a subdirectory, or exclude heavy vendor directories by placing them in `SKIP_DIRS` |
| Compliance score appears inflated because many controls show `warning` | Warnings score 0.5 (partial credit) in the weighted calculation | Treat any control below `passed` as requiring remediation; filter the JSON output for `status != "passed"` |

---

## Success Criteria

- **Zero critical CVEs in production** -- all critical-severity vulnerabilities are patched or mitigated before deployment.
- **Mean time to patch under 48 hours** -- critical and high-severity findings are remediated within two business days of detection.
- **Compliance score at or above 90%** -- the compliance checker returns `COMPLIANT` status for every applicable framework before each release.
- **100% of secrets externalized** -- the security scanner reports zero hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, private keys) across the entire codebase.
- **CI/CD security gate pass rate above 95%** -- fewer than 5% of pull requests are blocked by security scans, indicating proactive secure coding practices.
- **Incident response time under 15 minutes** -- security incidents are acknowledged and an incident commander assigned within the Phase 1 detection window.
- **Quarterly dependency audit cadence** -- the vulnerability assessor is executed against all ecosystems (npm, Python, Go) at least once per quarter with results documented.

---

## Scope & Limitations

**This skill covers:**

- Static analysis of source code for common vulnerability classes (secrets, injection, XSS, command injection, path traversal).
- Dependency vulnerability assessment against a built-in CVE database for npm, Python, and Go ecosystems.
- Compliance verification for SOC 2 Type II, PCI-DSS v4.0, HIPAA Security Rule, and GDPR.
- Security workflow orchestration including CI/CD gating, CVE triage, and incident response procedures.

**This skill does NOT cover:**

- Dynamic application security testing (DAST) or runtime analysis -- use OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite for live scanning.
- Infrastructure-as-code security (Terraform, CloudFormation misconfigurations) -- see the `senior-devops` skill for IaC hardening.
- Container image scanning or Kubernetes admission control -- see the `senior-devops` skill or use Trivy directly.
- Penetration testing execution or red-team operations -- these require specialized tooling and authorized human operators.

---

## Integration Points

| Skill | Integration | Data Flow |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| `senior-devops` | Infrastructure hardening and CI/CD pipeline configuration | Security scan results feed into deployment gates; DevOps provides container and IaC scanning |
| `senior-backend` | Secure coding patterns and input validation in server-side code | SecOps scanner findings drive backend remediation; backend applies parameterized queries and output encoding |
| `senior-qa` | Security test cases and regression verification after patches | Vulnerability reports generate QA test cases; QA confirms fixes do not introduce regressions |
| `senior-architect` | Threat modeling, defense-in-depth design, and zero-trust architecture | Compliance gaps inform architecture decisions; architect provides security design patterns |
| `code-reviewer` | Security-focused code review and pre-merge analysis | Scanner findings prioritize review focus areas; reviewer enforces secure coding standards |
| `senior-fullstack` | End-to-end security across frontend and API layers (XSS, CSRF, auth) | SecOps identifies frontend and API vulnerabilities; fullstack applies framework-level mitigations |
