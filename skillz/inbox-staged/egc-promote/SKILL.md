# Promote Command

Promote instincts from project scope to global scope in continuous-learning-v2.

## Implementation

Run the instinct CLI using the plugin root path:

```bash
python3 "${GEMINI_EXTENSION_ROOT}/skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py" promote [instinct-id] [--force] [--dry-run]
```

Or if `GEMINI_EXTENSION_ROOT` is not set (manual installation):

```bash
python3 ~/.gemini/skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py promote [instinct-id] [--force] [--dry-run]
```

## Usage

```bash
/egc-promote                      # Auto-detect promotion candidates
/egc-promote --dry-run            # Preview auto-promotion candidates
/egc-promote --force              # Promote all qualified candidates without prompt
/egc-promote grep-before-edit     # Promote one specific instinct from current project
```

## What to Do

1. Detect current project
2. If `instinct-id` is provided, promote only that instinct (if present in current project)
3. Otherwise, find cross-project candidates that:
   - Appear in at least 2 projects
   - Meet confidence threshold
4. Write promoted instincts to `~/.gemini/homunculus/instincts/personal/` with `scope: global`
