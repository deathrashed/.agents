This guide is an introduction to developing microservices-based applications and managing them
using containers. It discusses architectural design and implementation approaches using .NET and
Docker containers.
To make it easier to get started, the guide focuses on a reference containerized and microservice-
based application that you can explore. The reference application is available at the
eShopOnContainers GitHub repo.

Introduction
Enterprises are increasingly realizing cost savings, solving deployment problems, and improving
DevOps and production operations by using containers. Microsoft has been releasing container
innovations for Windows and Linux by creating products like Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure
Service Fabric, and by partnering with industry leaders like Docker, Mesosphere, and Kubernetes.
These products deliver container solutions that help companies build and deploy applications at cloud
speed and scale, whatever their choice of platform or tools.
Docker is becoming the de facto standard in the container industry, supported by the most significant
vendors in the Windows and Linux ecosystems. (Microsoft is one of the main cloud vendors
supporting Docker). In the future, Docker will probably be ubiquitous in any datacenter in the cloud or
on-premises.
In addition, the microservices architecture is emerging as an important approach for distributed
mission-critical applications. In a microservice-based architecture, the application is built on a
collection of services that can be developed, tested, deployed, and versioned independently.
About this guide
This guide is an introduction to developing microservices-based applications and managing them
using containers. It discusses architectural design and implementation approaches using .NET and
Docker containers. To make it easier to get started with containers and microservices, the guide
focuses on a reference containerized and microservice-based application that you can explore. The
sample application is available at the eShopOnContainers GitHub repo.


This guide provides foundational development and architectural guidance primarily at a development
environment level with a focus on two technologies: Docker and .NET. Our intention is that you read
this guide when thinking about your application design without focusing on the infrastructure (cloud
or on-premises) of your production environment. You will make decisions about your infrastructure
later, when you create your production-ready applications. Therefore, this guide is intended to be
infrastructure agnostic and more development-environment-centric.
After you have studied this guide, your next step would be to learn about production-ready
microservices on Microsoft Azure.
Version
This guide has been revised to cover .NET 7 version along with many additional updates related to
the same “wave” of technologies (that is, Azure and additional third-party technologies) coinciding in
time with the .NET 7 release. That’s why the book version has also been updated to version 7.0.
What this guide does not cover
This guide does not focus on the application lifecycle, DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, or team work. The
complementary guide Containerized Docker Application Lifecycle with Microsoft Platform and Tools
focuses on that subject. The current guide also does not provide implementation details on Azure
infrastructure, such as information on specific orchestrators.

Who should use this guide
We wrote this guide for developers and solution architects who are new to Docker-based application
development and to microservices-based architecture. This guide is for you if you want to learn how
to architect, design, and implement proof-of-concept applications with Microsoft development
technologies (with special focus on .NET) and with Docker containers.
You will also find this guide useful if you are a technical decision maker, such as an enterprise
architect, who wants an architecture and technology overview before you decide on what approach to
select for new and modern distributed applications.
How to use this guide
The first part of this guide introduces Docker containers, discusses how to choose between .NET 7 and
the .NET Framework as a development framework, and provides an overview of microservices. This
content is for architects and technical decision makers who want an overview but don’t need to focus
on code implementation details.


The second part of the guide starts with the Development process for Docker based applications
section. It focuses on the development and microservice patterns for implementing applications using
.NET and Docker. This section will be of most interest to developers and architects who want to focus
on code and on patterns and implementation details.
Related microservice and container-based reference
application: eShopOnContainers
The eShopOnContainers application is an open-source reference app for .NET and microservices that
is designed to be deployed using Docker containers. The application consists of multiple subsystems,
including several e-store UI front-ends (a Web MVC app, a Web SPA, and a native mobile app). It also
includes the back-end microservices and containers for all required server-side operations.
The purpose of the application is to showcase architectural patterns. IT IS NOT A PRODUCTION-
READY TEMPLATE to start real-world applications. In fact, the application is in a permanent beta
state, as it’s also used to test new potentially interesting technologies as they show up.

CHAPTER
Introduction to Containers
and Docker
Containerization is an approach to software development in which an application or service, its
dependencies, and its configuration (abstracted as deployment manifest files) are packaged together
as a container image. The containerized application can be tested as a unit and deployed as a
container image instance to the host operating system (OS).
Just as shipping containers allow goods to be transported by ship, train, or truck regardless of the
cargo inside, software containers act as a standard unit of software deployment that can contain
different code and dependencies. Containerizing software this way enables developers and IT
professionals to deploy them across environments with little or no modification.
Containers also isolate applications from each other on a shared OS. Containerized applications run
on top of a container host that in turn runs on the OS (Linux or Windows). Containers therefore have a
significantly smaller footprint than virtual machine (VM) images.
Each container can run a whole web application or a service, as shown in Figure 2-1. In this example,
Docker host is a container host, and App1, App2, Svc 1, and Svc 2 are containerized applications or
services.
Figure 2-1. Multiple containers running on a container host
1 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to Containers and Docker


Another benefit of containerization is scalability. You can scale out quickly by creating new containers
for short-term tasks. From an application point of view, instantiating an image (creating a container) is
similar to instantiating a process like a service or a web app. For reliability, however, when you run
multiple instances of the same image across multiple host servers, you typically want each container
(image instance) to run in a different host server or VM in different fault domains.
In short, containers offer the benefits of isolation, portability, agility, scalability, and control across the
whole application lifecycle workflow. The most important benefit is the environment’s isolation
provided between Dev and Ops.
What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-
sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises. Docker is also a company that
promotes and evolves this technology, working in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and Windows
vendors, including Microsoft.
Figure 2-2. Docker deploys containers at all layers of the hybrid cloud.
Docker containers can run anywhere, on-premises in the customer datacenter, in an external service
provider or in the cloud, on Azure. Docker image containers can run natively on Linux and Windows.
However, Windows images can run only on Windows hosts and Linux images can run on Linux hosts
and Windows hosts (using a Hyper-V Linux VM, so far), where host means a server or a VM.
Developers can use development environments on Windows, Linux, or macOS. On the development
computer, the developer runs a Docker host where Docker images are deployed, including the app
and its dependencies. Developers who work on Linux or on macOS use a Docker host that is Linux
based, and they can create images only for Linux containers. (Developers working on macOS can edit
code or run the Docker CLI from macOS, but as of the time of this writing, containers don’t run
2 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to Containers and Docker


directly on macOS.) Developers who work on Windows can create images for either Linux or Windows
Containers.
To host containers in development environments and provide additional developer tools, Docker
ships Docker Desktop for Windows or for macOS. These products install the necessary VM (the Docker
host) to host the containers.
To run Windows Containers, there are two types of runtimes:
• Windows Server Containers provide application isolation through process and namespace
isolation technology. A Windows Server Container shares a kernel with the container host and
with all containers running on the host.
• Hyper-V Containers expand on the isolation provided by Windows Server Containers by
running each container in a highly optimized virtual machine. In this configuration, the kernel
of the container host isn’t shared with the Hyper-V Containers, providing better isolation.
The images for these containers are created the same way and function the same. The difference is in
how the container is created from the image running a Hyper-V Container requires an extra
parameter. For details, see Hyper-V Containers.
Comparing Docker containers with virtual machines
Figure 2-3 shows a comparison between VMs and Docker containers.
Virtual Machines Docker Containers
3 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to Containers and Docker



Virtual Machines Docker Containers
Virtual machines include the application, the Containers include the application and all its
required libraries or binaries, and a full guest dependencies. However, they share the OS kernel
operating system. Full virtualization requires with other containers, running as isolated
more resources than containerization. processes in user space on the host operating
system. (Except in Hyper-V containers, where
each container runs inside of a special virtual
machine per container.)
Figure 2-3. Comparison of traditional virtual machines to Docker containers
For VMs, there are three base layers in the host server, from the bottom-up: infrastructure, Host
Operating System and a Hypervisor and on top of all that each VM has its own OS and all necessary
libraries. For Docker, the host server only has the infrastructure and the OS and on top of that, the
container engine, that keeps container isolated but sharing the base OS services.
Because containers require far fewer resources (for example, they don’t need a full OS), they’re easy to
deploy and they start fast. This allows you to have higher density, meaning that it allows you to run
more services on the same hardware unit, thereby reducing costs.
As a side effect of running on the same kernel, you get less isolation than VMs.
The main goal of an image is that it makes the environment (dependencies) the same across different
deployments. This means that you can debug it on your machine and then deploy it to another
machine with the same environment guaranteed.
A container image is a way to package an app or service and deploy it in a reliable and reproducible
way. You could say that Docker isn’t only a technology but also a philosophy and a process.
When using Docker, you won’t hear developers say, “It works on my machine, why not in production?”
They can simply say, “It runs on Docker”, because the packaged Docker application can be executed
on any supported Docker environment, and it runs the way it was intended to on all deployment
targets (such as Dev, QA, staging, and production).
A simple analogy
Perhaps a simple analogy can help getting the grasp of the core concept of Docker.
Let’s go back in time to the 1950s for a moment. There were no word processors, and the
photocopiers were used everywhere (kind of).
Imagine you’re responsible for quickly issuing batches of letters as required, to mail them to
customers, using real paper and envelopes, to be delivered physically to each customer’s address
(there was no email back then).
At some point, you realize the letters are just a composition of a large set of paragraphs, which are
picked and arranged as needed, according to the purpose of the letter, so you devise a system to
issue letters quickly, expecting to get a hefty raise.
The system is simple:
1. You begin with a deck of transparent sheets containing one paragraph each.
4 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to Containers and Docker

2. To issue a set of letters, you pick the sheets with the paragraphs you need, then you stack and
align them so they look and read fine.
3. Finally, you place the set in the photocopier and press start to produce as many letters as
required.
So, simplifying, that’s the core idea of Docker.
In Docker, each layer is the resulting set of changes that happen to the filesystem after executing a
command, such as, installing a program.
So, when you “look” at the filesystem after the layer has been copied, you see all the files, included in
the layer when the program was installed.
You can think of an image as an auxiliary read-only hard disk ready to be installed in a “computer”
where the operating system is already installed.
Similarly, you can think of a container as the “computer” with the image hard disk installed. The
container, just like a computer, can be powered on or off.
Docker terminology
This section lists terms and definitions you should be familiar with before getting deeper into Docker.
For further definitions, see the extensive glossary provided by Docker.
Container image: A package with all the dependencies and information needed to create a container.
An image includes all the dependencies (such as frameworks) plus deployment and execution
configuration to be used by a container runtime. Usually, an image derives from multiple base images
that are layers stacked on top of each other to form the container’s filesystem. An image is immutable
once it has been created.
Dockerfile: A text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It’s like a batch script,
the first line states the base image to begin with and then follow the instructions to install required
programs, copy files, and so on, until you get the working environment you need.
Build: The action of building a container image based on the information and context provided by its
Dockerfile, plus additional files in the folder where the image is built. You can build images with the
following Docker command:
docker build
Container: An instance of a Docker image. A container represents the execution of a single
application, process, or service. It consists of the contents of a Docker image, an execution
environment, and a standard set of instructions. When scaling a service, you create multiple instances
of a container from the same image. Or a batch job can create multiple containers from the same
image, passing different parameters to each instance.
Volumes: Offer a writable filesystem that the container can use. Since images are read-only but most
programs need to write to the filesystem, volumes add a writable layer, on top of the container image,
so the programs have access to a writable filesystem. The program doesn’t know it’s accessing a
5 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to Containers and Docker


---

layered filesystem, it’s just the filesystem as usual. Volumes live in the host system and are managed
by Docker.
Tag: A mark or label you can apply to images so that different images or versions of the same image
(depending on the version number or the target environment) can be identified.
Multi-stage Build: Is a feature, since Docker 17.05 or higher, that helps to reduce the size of the final
images. For example, a large base image, containing the SDK can be used for compiling and
publishing and then a small runtime-only base image can be used to host the application.
Repository (repo): A collection of related Docker images, labeled with a tag that indicates the image
version. Some repos contain multiple variants of a specific image, such as an image containing SDKs
(heavier), an image containing only runtimes (lighter), etc. Those variants can be marked with tags. A
single repo can contain platform variants, such as a Linux image and a Windows image.
Registry: A service that provides access to repositories. The default registry for most public images is
Docker Hub (owned by Docker as an organization). A registry usually contains repositories from
multiple teams. Companies often have private registries to store and manage images they’ve created.
Azure Container Registry is another example.
Multi-arch image: For multi-architecture (or multi-platform), it’s a Docker feature that simplifies the
selection of the appropriate image, according to the platform where Docker is running. For example,
when a Dockerfile requests a base image FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 from the
registry, it actually gets 7.0-nanoserver-ltsc2022, 7.0-nanoserver-1809 or 7.0-bullseye-slim,
depending on the operating system and version where Docker is running.
Docker Hub: A public registry to upload images and work with them. Docker Hub provides Docker
image hosting, public or private registries, build triggers and web hooks, and integration with GitHub
and Bitbucket.
Azure Container Registry: A public resource for working with Docker images and its components in
Azure. This provides a registry that’s close to your deployments in Azure and that gives you control
over access, making it possible to use your Azure Active Directory groups and permissions.
Docker Trusted Registry (DTR): A Docker registry service (from Docker) that can be installed on-
premises so it lives within the organization’s datacenter and network. It’s convenient for private
images that should be managed within the enterprise. Docker Trusted Registry is included as part of
the Docker Datacenter product.
Docker Desktop: Development tools for Windows and macOS for building, running, and testing
containers locally. Docker Desktop for Windows provides development environments for both Linux
and Windows Containers. The Linux Docker host on Windows is based on a Hyper-V virtual machine.
The host for Windows Containers is directly based on Windows. Docker Desktop for Mac is based on
the Apple Hypervisor framework and the xhyve hypervisor, which provides a Linux Docker host virtual
machine on macOS. Docker Desktop for Windows and for Mac replaces Docker Toolbox, which was
based on Oracle VirtualBox.
Compose: A command-line tool and YAML file format with metadata for defining and running multi-
container applications. You define a single application based on multiple images with one or more
.yml files that can override values depending on the environment. After you’ve created the definitions,
6 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to Containers and Docker

you can deploy the whole multi-container application with a single command (docker-compose up)
that creates a container per image on the Docker host.
Cluster: A collection of Docker hosts exposed as if it were a single virtual Docker host, so that the
application can scale to multiple instances of the services spread across multiple hosts within the
cluster. Docker clusters can be created with Kubernetes, Azure Service Fabric, Docker Swarm and
Mesosphere DC/OS.
Orchestrator: A tool that simplifies the management of clusters and Docker hosts. Orchestrators
enable you to manage their images, containers, and hosts through a command-line interface (CLI) or a
graphical UI. You can manage container networking, configurations, load balancing, service discovery,
high availability, Docker host configuration, and more. An orchestrator is responsible for running,
distributing, scaling, and healing workloads across a collection of nodes. Typically, orchestrator
products are the same products that provide cluster infrastructure, like Kubernetes and Azure Service
Fabric, among other offerings in the market.
Docker containers, images, and registries
When using Docker, a developer creates an app or service and packages it and its dependencies into
a container image. An image is a static representation of the app or service and its configuration and
dependencies.
To run the app or service, the app’s image is instantiated to create a container, which will be running
on the Docker host. Containers are initially tested in a development environment or PC.
Developers should store images in a registry, which acts as a library of images and is needed when
deploying to production orchestrators. Docker maintains a public registry via Docker Hub; other
vendors provide registries for different collections of images, including Azure Container Registry.
Alternatively, enterprises can have a private registry on-premises for their own Docker images.
Figure 2-4 shows how images and registries in Docker relate to other components. It also shows the
multiple registry offerings from vendors.
7 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to Containers and Docker

Figure 2-4. Taxonomy of Docker terms and concepts
The registry is like a bookshelf where images are stored and available to be pulled for building
containers to run services or web apps. There are private Docker registries on-premises and on the
public cloud. Docker Hub is a public registry maintained by Docker, along the Docker Trusted Registry
an enterprise-grade solution, Azure offers the Azure Container Registry. AWS, Google, and others also
have container registries.
Putting images in a registry lets you store static and immutable application bits, including all their
dependencies at a framework level. Those images can then be versioned and deployed in multiple
environments and therefore provide a consistent deployment unit.
Private image registries, either hosted on-premises or in the cloud, are recommended when:
• Your images must not be shared publicly due to confidentiality.
• You want to have minimum network latency between your images and your chosen
deployment environment. For example, if your production environment is Azure cloud, you
probably want to store your images in Azure Container Registry so that network latency will
be minimal. In a similar way, if your production environment is on-premises, you might want
to have an on-premises Docker Trusted Registry available within the same local network.

CHAPTER
Choosing Between .NET
and .NET Framework for
Docker Containers
There are two supported frameworks for building server-side containerized Docker applications with
.NET: .NET Framework and .NET 7. They share many .NET platform components, and you can share
code across the two. However, there are fundamental differences between them, and which
framework you use will depend on what you want to accomplish. This section provides guidance on
when to choose each framework.
General guidance
This section provides a summary of when to choose .NET 7 or .NET Framework. We provide more
details about these choices in the sections that follow.
Use .NET 7, with Linux or Windows Containers, for your containerized Docker server application when:
• You have cross-platform needs. For example, you want to use both Linux and Windows
Containers.
• Your application architecture is based on microservices.
• You need to start containers fast and want a small footprint per container to achieve better
density or more containers per hardware unit in order to lower your costs.
In short, when you create new containerized .NET applications, you should consider .NET 7 as the
default choice. It has many benefits and fits best with the containers philosophy and style of working.
An extra benefit of using .NET 7 is that you can run side-by-side .NET versions for applications within
the same machine. This benefit is more important for servers or VMs that do not use containers,
because containers isolate the versions of .NET that the app needs. (As long as they are compatible
with the underlying OS.)
Use .NET Framework for your containerized Docker server application when:
• Your application currently uses .NET Framework and has strong dependencies on Windows.
9 CHAPTER 2 | Choosing Between .NET and .NET Framework for Docker Containers

• You need to use Windows APIs that are not supported by .NET 7.
• You need to use third-party .NET libraries or NuGet packages that are not available for .NET 7.
Using .NET Framework on Docker can improve your deployment experiences by minimizing
deployment issues. This “lift and shift” scenario is important for containerizing legacy applications that
were originally developed with the traditional .NET Framework, like ASP.NET WebForms, MVC web
apps, or WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) services.

Containers

https://aka.ms/eshopmodernizing
When to choose .NET for Docker containers
The modularity and lightweight nature of .NET 7 makes it perfect for containers. When you deploy
and start a container, its image is far smaller with .NET 7 than with .NET Framework. In contrast, to use
.NET Framework for a container, you must base your image on the Windows Server Core image, which
is a lot heavier than the Windows Nano Server or Linux images that you use for .NET 7.
Additionally, .NET 7 is cross-platform, so you can deploy server apps with Linux or Windows container
images. However, if you are using the traditional .NET Framework, you can only deploy images based
on Windows Server Core.
The following is a more detailed explanation of why to choose .NET 7.
Developing and deploying cross platform
Clearly, if your goal is to have an application (web app or service) that can run on multiple platforms
supported by Docker (Linux and Windows), the right choice is .NET 7, because .NET Framework only
supports Windows.
.NET 7 also supports macOS as a development platform. However, when you deploy containers to a
Docker host, that host must (currently) be based on Linux or Windows. For example, in a development
environment, you could use a Linux VM running on a Mac.
Visual Studio provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for Windows and supports
Docker development.
Visual Studio for Mac is an IDE, evolution of Xamarin Studio, that runs on macOS and supports
Docker-based application development. This tool should be the preferred choice for developers
working in Mac machines who also want to use a powerful IDE.
You can also use Visual Studio Code on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Visual Studio Code fully
supports .NET 7, including IntelliSense and debugging. Because VS Code is a lightweight editor, you
10 CHAPTER 2 | Choosing Between .NET and .NET Framework for Docker Containers

can use it to develop containerized apps on the machine in conjunction with the Docker CLI and the
.NET CLI. You can also target .NET 7 with most third-party editors like Sublime, Emacs, vi, and the
open-source OmniSharp project, which also provides IntelliSense support.
In addition to the IDEs and editors, you can use the .NET CLI for all supported platforms.
Using containers for new (“green-field”) projects
Containers are commonly used in conjunction with a microservices architecture, although they can
also be used to containerize web apps or services that follow any architectural pattern. You can use
.NET Framework on Windows Containers, but the modularity and lightweight nature of .NET 7 makes
it perfect for containers and microservices architectures. When you create and deploy a container, its
image is far smaller with .NET 7 than with .NET Framework.
Create and deploy microservices on containers
You could use the traditional .NET Framework for building microservices-based applications (without
containers) by using plain processes. That way, because the .NET Framework is already installed and
shared across processes, processes are light and fast to start. However, if you are using containers, the
image for the traditional .NET Framework is also based on Windows Server Core and that makes it too
heavy for a microservices-on-containers approach. However, teams have been looking for
opportunities to improve the experience for .NET Framework users as well. Recently, size of the
Windows Server Core container images have been reduced to >40% smaller.
On the other hand, .NET 7 is the best candidate if you’re embracing a microservices-oriented system
that is based on containers because .NET 7 is lightweight. In addition, its related container images, for
either Linux or Windows Nano Server, are lean and small, making containers light and fast to start.
A microservice is meant to be as small as possible: to be light when spinning up, to have a small
footprint, to have a small Bounded Context (check DDD, Domain-Driven Design), to represent a small
area of concerns, and to be able to start and stop fast. For those requirements, you will want to use
small and fast-to-instantiate container images like the .NET 7 container image.
A microservices architecture also allows you to mix technologies across a service boundary. This
approach enables a gradual migration to .NET 7 for new microservices that work in conjunction with
other microservices or with services developed with Node.js, Python, Java, GoLang, or other
technologies.
Deploying high density in scalable systems
When your container-based system needs the best possible density, granularity, and performance,
.NET and ASP.NET Core are your best options. ASP.NET Core is up to 10 times faster than ASP.NET in
the traditional .NET Framework, and it leads to other popular industry technologies for microservices,
such as Java servlets, Go, and Node.js.
This approach is especially relevant for microservices architectures, where you could have hundreds of
microservices (containers) running. With ASP.NET Core images (based on the .NET runtime) on Linux
or Windows Nano, you can run your system with a much lower number of servers or VMs, ultimately
saving costs in infrastructure and hosting.
11 CHAPTER 2 | Choosing Between .NET and .NET Framework for Docker Containers

When to choose .NET Framework for Docker
containers
While .NET 7 offers significant benefits for new applications and application patterns, .NET Framework
will continue to be a good choice for many existing scenarios.
Migrating existing applications directly to a Windows Server container
You might want to use Docker containers just to simplify deployment, even if you are not creating
microservices. For example, perhaps you want to improve your DevOps workflow with Docker—
containers can give you better isolated test environments and can also eliminate deployment issues
caused by missing dependencies when you move to a production environment. In cases like these,
even if you are deploying a monolithic application, it makes sense to use Docker and Windows
Containers for your current .NET Framework applications.
In most cases for this scenario, you will not need to migrate your existing applications to .NET 7; you
can use Docker containers that include the traditional .NET Framework. However, a recommended
approach is to use .NET 7 as you extend an existing application, such as writing a new service in
ASP.NET Core.
Using third-party .NET libraries or NuGet packages not available for
.NET 7
Third-party libraries are quickly embracing .NET Standard, which enables code sharing across all .NET
flavors, including .NET 7. With .NET Standard 2.0 and later, the API surface compatibility across
different frameworks has become significantly larger. Even more, .NET Core 2.x and newer applications
can also directly reference existing .NET Framework libraries (see .NET Framework 4.6.1 supporting
.NET Standard 2.0).
In addition, the Windows Compatibility Pack extends the API surface available for .NET Standard 2.0
on Windows. This pack allows recompiling most existing code to .NET Standard 2.x with little or no
modification, to run on Windows.
However, even with that exceptional progression since .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Core 2.1 or later,
there might be cases where certain NuGet packages need Windows to run and might not support
.NET Core or later. If those packages are critical for your application, then you will need to use .NET
Framework on Windows Containers.
Using .NET technologies not available for .NET 7
Some .NET Framework technologies aren’t available in .NET 7. Some of them might become available
in later releases, but others don’t fit the new application patterns targeted by .NET Core and might
never be available.
The following list shows most of the technologies that aren’t available in .NET 7:
12 CHAPTER 2 | Choosing Between .NET and .NET Framework for Docker Containers

• ASP.NET Web Forms. This technology is only available on .NET Framework. Currently there are
no plans to bring ASP.NET Web Forms to .NET or later.
• Workflow-related services. Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Workflow Services (WCF +
WF in a single service), and WCF Data Services (formerly known as ADO.NET Data Services)
are only available on .NET Framework. There are currently no plans to bring them to .NET 7.
In addition to the technologies listed in the official .NET roadmap, other features might be ported to
the new unified .NET platform. You might consider participating in the discussions on GitHub so that
your voice can be heard. And if you think something is missing, file a new issue in the dotnet/runtime
GitHub repository.
Using a platform or API that doesn’t support .NET 7
Some Microsoft and third-party platforms don’t support .NET 7. For example, some Azure services
provide an SDK that isn’t yet available for consumption on .NET 7 yet. Most Azure SDK should
eventually be ported to .NET 7/.NET Standard, but some might not for several reasons. You can see
the available Azure SDKs in the Azure SDK Latest Releases page.
In the meantime, if any platform or service in Azure still doesn’t support .NET 7 with its client API, you
can use the equivalent REST API from the Azure service or the client SDK on .NET Framework.
Porting existing ASP.NET application to .NET 7
.NET Core is a revolutionary step forward from .NET Framework. It offers a host of advantages over
.NET Framework across the board from productivity to performance, and from cross-platform support
to developer satisfaction. If you are using .NET Framework and planning to migrate your application
to .NET Core or .NET 5+, see Porting Existing ASP.NET Apps to .NET Core.

Decision table: .NET implementations to use for

What OS to target with .NET containers
Given the diversity of operating systems supported by Docker and the differences between .NET
Framework and .NET 7, you should target a specific OS and specific versions depending on the
framework you are using.
For Windows, you can use Windows Server Core or Windows Nano Server. These Windows versions
provide different characteristics (IIS in Windows Server Core versus a self-hosted web server like
Kestrel in Nano Server) that might be needed by .NET Framework or .NET 7, respectively.
For Linux, multiple distros are available and supported in official .NET Docker images (like Debian).
14 CHAPTER 2 | Choosing Between .NET and .NET Framework for Docker Containers

In Figure 3-1, you can see the possible OS version depending on the .NET framework used.
Figure 3-1. Operating systems to target depending on versions of the .NET framework
When deploying legacy .NET Framework applications you have to target Windows Server Core,
compatible with legacy apps and IIS, but it has a larger image. When deploying .NET 7 applications,
you can target Windows Nano Server, which is cloud optimized, uses Kestrel and is smaller and starts
faster. You can also target Linux, supporting Debian, Alpine, and others.
You can also create your own Docker image in cases where you want to use a different Linux distro or
where you want an image with versions not provided by Microsoft. For example, you might create an
image with ASP.NET Core running on the traditional .NET Framework and Windows Server Core, which
is a not-so-common scenario for Docker.
When you add the image name to your Dockerfile file, you can select the operating system and
version depending on the tag you use, as in the following examples:
Image Comments
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0 .NET 7 multi-architecture: Supports Linux and Windows
Nano Server depending on the Docker host.
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 ASP.NET Core 7.0 multi-architecture: Supports Linux and
Windows Nano Server depending on the Docker host.
The aspnetcore image has a few optimizations for
ASP.NET Core.

15 CHAPTER 2 | Choosing Between .NET and .NET Framework for Docker Containers



---

Official .NET Docker images
The Official .NET Docker images are Docker images created and optimized by Microsoft. They’re
publicly available on Microsoft Artifact Registry. You can search over the catalog to find all .NET image
repositories, for example .NET SDK repository.
Each repository can contain multiple images, depending on .NET versions, and depending on the OS
and versions (Linux Debian, Linux Alpine, Windows Nano Server, Windows Server Core, and so on).
Image repositories provide extensive tagging to help you select not just a specific framework version,
but also to choose an OS (Linux distribution or Windows version).
.NET and Docker image optimizations for development versus
production
When building Docker images for developers, Microsoft focused on the following main scenarios:
• Images used to develop and build .NET apps.
• Images used to run .NET apps.
Why multiple images? When developing, building, and running containerized applications, you usually
have different priorities. By providing different images for these separate tasks, Microsoft helps
optimize the separate processes of developing, building, and deploying apps.
During development and build
During development, what is important is how fast you can iterate changes, and the ability to debug
the changes. The size of the image isn’t as important as the ability to make changes to your code and
see the changes quickly. Some tools and “build-agent containers”, use the development .NET image
(mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0) during development and build process. When building inside a
Docker container, the important aspects are the elements that are needed to compile your app. This
includes the compiler and any other .NET dependencies.
Why is this type of build image important? You don’t deploy this image to production. Instead, it’s an
image that you use to build the content you place into a production image. This image would be used
in your continuous integration (CI) environment or build environment when using Docker multi-stage
builds.
In production
What is important in production is how fast you can deploy and start your containers based on a
production .NET image. Therefore, the runtime-only image based on
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 is small so that it can travel quickly across the network from your
Docker registry to your Docker hosts. The contents are ready to run, enabling the fastest time from
starting the container to processing results. In the Docker model, there is no need for compilation
from C# code, as there’s when you run dotnet build or dotnet publish when using the build container.
16 CHAPTER 2 | Choosing Between .NET and .NET Framework for Docker Containers

In this optimized image, you put only the binaries and other content needed to run the application.
For example, the content created by dotnet publish contains only the compiled .NET binaries, images,
.js, and .css files. Over time, you’ll see images that contain pre-jitted (the compilation from IL to native
that occurs at run time) packages.
Although there are multiple versions of the .NET and ASP.NET Core images, they all share one or more
layers, including the base layer. Therefore, the amount of disk space needed to store an image is
small; it consists only of the delta between your custom image and its base image. The result is that
it’s quick to pull the image from your registry.
When you explore the .NET image repositories at Microsoft Artifact Registry, you’ll find multiple image
versions classified or marked with tags. These tags help to decide which one to use, depending on the
version you need, like those in the following table:
Image Comments
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 ASP.NET Core, with runtime only and ASP.NET Core
optimizations, on Linux and Windows (multi-arch)
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 .NET 7, with SDKs included, on Linux and Windows
(multi-arch)
You can find all the available docker images in dotnet-docker and also refer to the latest preview
releases by using nightly build mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/nightly/*

CHAPTER
Architecting container and
microservice-based
applications
Microservices offer great benefits but also raise huge new challenges. Microservice architecture patterns
are fundamental pillars when creating a microservice-based application.
Earlier in this guide, you learned basic concepts about containers and Docker. That information was
the minimum you needed to get started with containers. Even though containers are enablers of, and
a great fit for microservices, they aren’t mandatory for a microservice architecture. Many architectural
concepts in this architecture section could be applied without containers. However, this guide focuses
on the intersection of both due to the already introduced importance of containers.
Enterprise applications can be complex and are often composed of multiple services instead of a
single service-based application. For those cases, you need to understand other architectural
approaches, such as the microservices and certain Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns plus
container orchestration concepts. Note that this chapter describes not just microservices on
containers, but any containerized application, as well.
Container design principles
In the container model, a container image instance represents a single process. By defining a
container image as a process boundary, you can create primitives that can be used to scale or batch
the process.
When you design a container image, you’ll see an ENTRYPOINT definition in the Dockerfile. This
definition defines the process whose lifetime controls the lifetime of the container. When the process
completes, the container lifecycle ends. Containers might represent long-running processes like web
servers, but can also represent short-lived processes like batch jobs, which formerly might have been
implemented as Azure WebJobs.
If the process fails, the container ends, and the orchestrator takes over. If the orchestrator was
configured to keep five instances running and one fails, the orchestrator will create another container
instance to replace the failed process. In a batch job, the process is started with parameters. When the
process completes, the work is complete. This guidance drills-down on orchestrators, later on.
18 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

You might find a scenario where you want multiple processes running in a single container. For that
scenario, since there can be only one entry point per container, you could run a script within the
container that launches as many programs as needed. For example, you can use Supervisor or a
similar tool to take care of launching multiple processes inside a single container. However, even
though you can find architectures that hold multiple processes per container, that approach isn’t very
common.
Containerizing monolithic applications
You might want to build a single, monolithically deployed web application or service and deploy it as
a container. The application itself might not be internally monolithic, but structured as several
libraries, components, or even layers (application layer, domain layer, data-access layer, etc.).
Externally, however, it’s a single container—a single process, a single web application, or a single
service.
To manage this model, you deploy a single container to represent the application. To increase
capacity, you scale out, that is, just add more copies with a load balancer in front. The simplicity
comes from managing a single deployment in a single container or VM.
Figure 4-1. Example of the architecture of a containerized monolithic application
You can include multiple components, libraries, or internal layers in each container, as illustrated in
Figure 4-1. A monolithic containerized application has most of its functionality within a single
container, with internal layers or libraries, and scales out by cloning the container on multiple
servers/VMs. However, this monolithic pattern might conflict with the container principle “a container
does one thing, and does it in one process”, but might be ok for some cases.
The downside of this approach becomes evident if the application grows, requiring it to scale. If the
entire application can scale, it isn’t really a problem. However, in most cases, just a few parts of the
application are the choke points that require scaling, while other components are used less.
For example, in a typical e-commerce application, you likely need to scale the product information
subsystem, because many more customers browse products than purchase them. More customers use
19 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


their basket than use the payment pipeline. Fewer customers add comments or view their purchase
history. And you might have only a handful of employees that need to manage the content and
marketing campaigns. If you scale the monolithic design, all the code for these different tasks is
deployed multiple times and scaled at the same grade.
There are multiple ways to scale an application-horizontal duplication, splitting different areas of the
application, and partitioning similar business concepts or data. But, in addition to the problem of
scaling all components, changes to a single component require complete retesting of the entire
application, and a complete redeployment of all the instances.
However, the monolithic approach is common, because the development of the application is initially
easier than for microservices approaches. Thus, many organizations develop using this architectural
approach. While some organizations have had good enough results, others are hitting limits. Many
organizations designed their applications using this model because tools and infrastructure made it
too difficult to build service-oriented architectures (SOA) years ago, and they did not see the need-
until the application grew.
From an infrastructure perspective, each server can run many applications within the same host and
have an acceptable ratio of efficiency in resources usage, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2. Monolithic approach: Host running multiple apps, each app running as a container
Monolithic applications in Microsoft Azure can be deployed using dedicated VMs for each instance.
Additionally, using Azure virtual machine scale sets, you can easily scale the VMs. Azure App Service
can also run monolithic applications and easily scale instances without requiring you to manage the
VMs. Since 2016, Azure App Services can run single instances of Docker containers as well, simplifying
deployment.
As a QA environment or a limited production environment, you can deploy multiple Docker host VMs
and balance them using the Azure balancer, as shown in Figure 4-3. This lets you manage scaling with
a coarse-grain approach, because the whole application lives within a single container.
20 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


Figure 4-3. Example of multiple hosts scaling up a single container application
Deployment to the various hosts can be managed with traditional deployment techniques. Docker
hosts can be managed with commands like docker run or docker-compose performed manually, or
through automation such as continuous delivery (CD) pipelines.
Deploying a monolithic application as a container
There are benefits to using containers to manage monolithic application deployments. Scaling
container instances is far faster and easier than deploying additional VMs. Even if you use virtual
machine scale sets, VMs take time to start. When deployed as traditional application instances instead
of containers, the configuration of the application is managed as part of the VM, which isn’t ideal.
Deploying updates as Docker images is far faster and network efficient. Docker images typically start
in seconds, which speeds rollouts. Tearing down a Docker image instance is as easy as issuing a
docker stop command, and typically completes in less than a second.
Because containers are immutable by design, you never need to worry about corrupted VMs. In
contrast, update scripts for a VM might forget to account for some specific configuration or file left on
disk.
While monolithic applications can benefit from Docker, we’re touching only on the benefits.
Additional benefits of managing containers come from deploying with container orchestrators, which
manage the various instances and lifecycle of each container instance. Breaking up the monolithic
application into subsystems that can be scaled, developed, and deployed individually is your entry
point into the realm of microservices.
Publishing a single-container-based application to Azure App Service
Whether you want to get validation of a container deployed to Azure or when an application is simply
a single-container application, Azure App Service provides a great way to provide scalable single-
container-based services. Using Azure App Service is simple. It provides great integration with Git to
make it easy to take your code, build it in Visual Studio, and deploy it directly to Azure.
21 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


Figure 4-4. Publishing a single-container application to Azure App Service from Visual Studio 2022
Without Docker, if you needed other capabilities, frameworks, or dependencies that aren’t supported
in Azure App Service, you had to wait until the Azure team updated those dependencies in App
Service. Or you had to switch to other services like Azure Cloud Services or VMs, where you had
further control and you could install a required component or framework for your application.
Container support in Visual Studio 2017 and later gives you the ability to include whatever you want
in your application environment, as shown in Figure 4-4. Since you’re running it in a container, if you
add a dependency to your application, you can include the dependency in your Dockerfile or Docker
image.
As also shown in Figure 4-4, the publish flow pushes an image through a container registry. This can
be the Azure Container Registry (a registry close to your deployments in Azure and secured by Azure
Active Directory groups and accounts), or any other Docker registry, like Docker Hub or an on-
premises registry.
Manage state and data in Docker applications
In most cases, you can think of a container as an instance of a process. A process doesn’t maintain
persistent state. While a container can write to its local storage, assuming that an instance will be
around indefinitely would be like assuming that a single location in memory will be durable. You
22 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


should assume that container images, like processes, have multiple instances or will eventually be
killed. If they’re managed with a container orchestrator, you should assume that they might get
moved from one node or VM to another.
The following solutions are used to manage data in Docker applications:
From the Docker host, as Docker Volumes:
• Volumes are stored in an area of the host filesystem that’s managed by Docker.
• Bind mounts can map to any folder in the host filesystem, so access can’t be controlled from
Docker process and can pose a security risk as a container could access sensitive OS folders.
• tmpfs mounts are like virtual folders that only exist in the host’s memory and are never
written to the filesystem.
From remote storage:
• Azure Storage, which provides geo-distributable storage, providing a good long-term
persistence solution for containers.
• Remote relational databases like Azure SQL Database or NoSQL databases like Azure Cosmos
DB, or cache services like Redis.
From the Docker container:
• Overlay File System. This Docker feature implements a copy-on-write task that stores
updated information to the root file system of the container. That information is “on top” of
the original image on which the container is based. If the container is deleted from the
system, those changes are lost. Therefore, while it’s possible to save the state of a container
within its local storage, designing a system around this would conflict with the premise of
container design, which by default is stateless.
However, using Docker Volumes is now the preferred way to handle local data in Docker. If you need
more information about storage in containers check on Docker storage drivers and About storage
drivers.
The following provides more detail about these options:
Volumes are directories mapped from the host OS to directories in containers. When code in the
container has access to the directory, that access is actually to a directory on the host OS. This
directory is not tied to the lifetime of the container itself, and the directory is managed by Docker and
isolated from the core functionality of the host machine. Thus, data volumes are designed to persist
data independently of the life of the container. If you delete a container or an image from the Docker
host, the data persisted in the data volume isn’t deleted.
Volumes can be named or anonymous (the default). Named volumes are the evolution of Data
Volume Containers and make it easy to share data between containers. Volumes also support
volume drivers that allow you to store data on remote hosts, among other options.
Bind mounts are available since a long time ago and allow the mapping of any folder to a mount
point in a container. Bind mounts have more limitations than volumes and some important security
issues, so volumes are the recommended option.
23 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

tmpfs mounts are basically virtual folders that live only in the host’s memory and are never written to
the filesystem. They are fast and secure but use memory and are only meant for temporary, non-
persistent data.
As shown in Figure 4-5, regular Docker volumes can be stored outside of the containers themselves
but within the physical boundaries of the host server or VM. However, Docker containers can’t access
a volume from one host server or VM to another. In other words, with these volumes, it isn’t possible
to manage data shared between containers that run on different Docker hosts, although it could be
achieved with a volume driver that supports remote hosts.
Figure 4-5. Volumes and external data sources for container-based applications
Volumes can be shared between containers, but only in the same host, unless you use a remote driver
that supports remote hosts. In addition, when Docker containers are managed by an orchestrator,
containers might “move” between hosts, depending on the optimizations performed by the cluster.
Therefore, it isn’t recommended that you use data volumes for business data. But they’re a good
mechanism to work with trace files, temporal files, or similar that will not impact business data
consistency.
Remote data sources and cache tools like Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, or a remote cache
like Redis can be used in containerized applications the same way they are used when developing
without containers. This is a proven way to store business application data.
Azure Storage. Business data usually will need to be placed in external resources or databases, like
Azure Storage. Azure Storage, in concrete, provides the following services in the cloud:
• Blob storage stores unstructured object data. A blob can be any type of text or binary data,
such as document or media files (images, audio, and video files). Blob storage is also referred
to as Object storage.
24 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


• File storage offers shared storage for legacy applications using standard SMB protocol. Azure
virtual machines and cloud services can share file data across application components via
mounted shares. On-premises applications can access file data in a share via the File service
REST API.
• Table storage stores structured datasets. Table storage is a NoSQL key-attribute data store,
which allows rapid development and fast access to large quantities of data.
Relational databases and NoSQL databases. There are many choices for external databases, from
relational databases like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or NoSQL databases like Azure Cosmos DB,
MongoDB, etc. These databases are not going to be explained as part of this guide since they are in a
completely different subject.
Service-oriented architecture
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) was an overused term and has meant different things to different
people. But as a common denominator, SOA means that you structure your application by
decomposing it into multiple services (most commonly as HTTP services) that can be classified as
different types like subsystems or tiers.
Those services can now be deployed as Docker containers, which solves deployment issues, because
all the dependencies are included in the container image. However, when you need to scale up SOA
applications, you might have scalability and availability challenges if you’re deploying based on single
Docker hosts. This is where Docker clustering software or an orchestrator can help you, as explained in
later sections where deployment approaches for microservices are described.
Docker containers are useful (but not required) for both traditional service-oriented architectures and
the more advanced microservices architectures.
Microservices derive from SOA, but SOA is different from microservices architecture. Features like
large central brokers, central orchestrators at the organization level, and the Enterprise Service Bus
(ESB) are typical in SOA. But in most cases, these are anti-patterns in the microservice community. In
fact, some people argue that “The microservice architecture is SOA done right.”
This guide focuses on microservices, because a SOA approach is less prescriptive than the
requirements and techniques used in a microservice architecture. If you know how to build a
microservice-based application, you also know how to build a simpler service-oriented application.
Microservices architecture
As the name implies, a microservices architecture is an approach to building a server application as a
set of small services. That means a microservices architecture is mainly oriented to the back-end,
although the approach is also being used for the front end. Each service runs in its own process and
communicates with other processes using protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, or AMQP.
Each microservice implements a specific end-to-end domain or business capability within a certain
context boundary, and each must be developed autonomously and be deployable independently.
Finally, each microservice should own its related domain data model and domain logic (sovereignty
25 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


---

and decentralized data management) and could be based on different data storage technologies
(SQL, NoSQL) and different programming languages.
What size should a microservice be? When developing a microservice, size shouldn’t be the important
point. Instead, the important point should be to create loosely coupled services so you have
autonomy of development, deployment, and scale, for each service. Of course, when identifying and
designing microservices, you should try to make them as small as possible as long as you don’t have
too many direct dependencies with other microservices. More important than the size of the
microservice is the internal cohesion it must have and its independence from other services.
Why a microservices architecture? In short, it provides long-term agility. Microservices enable better
maintainability in complex, large, and highly-scalable systems by letting you create applications based
on many independently deployable services that each have granular and autonomous lifecycles.
As an additional benefit, microservices can scale out independently. Instead of having a single
monolithic application that you must scale out as a unit, you can instead scale out specific
microservices. That way, you can scale just the functional area that needs more processing power or
network bandwidth to support demand, rather than scaling out other areas of the application that
don’t need to be scaled. That means cost savings because you need less hardware.
Figure 4-6. Monolithic deployment versus the microservices approach
As Figure 4-6 shows, in the traditional monolithic approach, the application scales by cloning the
whole app in several servers/VM. In the microservices approach, functionality is segregated in smaller
services, so each service can scale independently. The microservices approach allows agile changes
and rapid iteration of each microservice, because you can change specific, small areas of complex,
large, and scalable applications.
Architecting fine-grained microservices-based applications enables continuous integration and
continuous delivery practices. It also accelerates delivery of new functions into the application. Fine-
grained composition of applications also allows you to run and test microservices in isolation, and to
26 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


evolve them autonomously while maintaining clear contracts between them. As long as you don’t
change the interfaces or contracts, you can change the internal implementation of any microservice or
add new functionality without breaking other microservices.
The following are important aspects to enable success in going into production with a microservices-
based system:
• Monitoring and health checks of the services and infrastructure.
• Scalable infrastructure for the services (that is, cloud and orchestrators).
• Security design and implementation at multiple levels: authentication, authorization, secrets
management, secure communication, etc.
• Rapid application delivery, usually with different teams focusing on different microservices.
• DevOps and CI/CD practices and infrastructure.
Of these, only the first three are covered or introduced in this guide. The last two points, which are
related to application lifecycle, are covered in the additional Containerized Docker Application
Lifecycle with Microsoft Platform and Tools e-book.

Data sovereignty per microservice
An important rule for microservices architecture is that each microservice must own its domain data
and logic. Just as a full application owns its logic and data, so must each microservice own its logic
and data under an autonomous lifecycle, with independent deployment per microservice.
This means that the conceptual model of the domain will differ between subsystems or microservices.
Consider enterprise applications, where customer relationship management (CRM) applications,
27 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

transactional purchase subsystems, and customer support subsystems each call on unique customer
entity attributes and data, and where each employs a different Bounded Context (BC).
This principle is similar in Domain-driven design (DDD), where each Bounded Context or autonomous
subsystem or service must own its domain model (data plus logic and behavior). Each DDD Bounded
Context correlates to one business microservice (one or several services). This point about the
Bounded Context pattern is expanded in the next section.
On the other hand, the traditional (monolithic data) approach used in many applications is to have a
single centralized database or just a few databases. This is often a normalized SQL database that’s
used for the whole application and all its internal subsystems, as shown in Figure 4-7.
Figure 4-7. Data sovereignty comparison: monolithic database versus microservices
In the traditional approach, there’s a single database shared across all services, typically in a tiered
architecture. In the microservices approach, each microservice owns its model/data. The centralized
database approach initially looks simpler and seems to enable reuse of entities in different subsystems
to make everything consistent. But the reality is you end up with huge tables that serve many different
subsystems, and that include attributes and columns that aren’t needed in most cases. It’s like trying
to use the same physical map for hiking a short trail, taking a day-long car trip, and learning
geography.
A monolithic application with typically a single relational database has two important benefits: ACID
transactions and the SQL language, both working across all the tables and data related to your
application. This approach provides a way to easily write a query that combines data from multiple
tables.
However, data access becomes much more complicated when you move to a microservices
architecture. Even when using ACID transactions within a microservice or Bounded Context, it is crucial
to consider that the data owned by each microservice is private to that microservice and should only
28 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


be accessed either synchronously through its API endpoints(REST, gRPC, SOAP, etc) or asynchronously
via messaging(AMQP or similar).
Encapsulating the data ensures that the microservices are loosely coupled and can evolve
independently of one another. If multiple services were accessing the same data, schema updates
would require coordinated updates to all the services. This would break the microservice lifecycle
autonomy. But distributed data structures mean that you can’t make a single ACID transaction across
microservices. This in turn means you must use eventual consistency when a business process spans
multiple microservices. This is much harder to implement than simple SQL joins, because you can’t
create integrity constraints or use distributed transactions between separate databases, as we’ll
explain later on. Similarly, many other relational database features aren’t available across multiple
microservices.
Going even further, different microservices often use different kinds of databases. Modern
applications store and process diverse kinds of data, and a relational database isn’t always the best
choice. For some use cases, a NoSQL database such as Azure CosmosDB or MongoDB might have a
more convenient data model and offer better performance and scalability than a SQL database like
SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. In other cases, a relational database is still the best approach.
Therefore, microservices-based applications often use a mixture of SQL and NoSQL databases, which
is sometimes called the polyglot persistence approach.
A partitioned, polyglot-persistent architecture for data storage has many benefits. These include
loosely coupled services and better performance, scalability, costs, and manageability. However, it can
introduce some distributed data management challenges, as explained in “Identifying domain-model
boundaries” later in this chapter.
The relationship between microservices and the Bounded Context
pattern
The concept of microservice derives from the Bounded Context (BC) pattern in domain-driven design
(DDD). DDD deals with large models by dividing them into multiple BCs and being explicit about their
boundaries. Each BC must have its own model and database; likewise, each microservice owns its
related data. In addition, each BC usually has its own ubiquitous language to help communication
between software developers and domain experts.
Those terms (mainly domain entities) in the ubiquitous language can have different names in different
Bounded Contexts, even when different domain entities share the same identity (that is, the unique ID
that’s used to read the entity from storage). For instance, in a user-profile Bounded Context, the User
domain entity might share identity with the Buyer domain entity in the ordering Bounded Context.
A microservice is therefore like a Bounded Context, but it also specifies that it’s a distributed service.
It’s built as a separate process for each Bounded Context, and it must use the distributed protocols
noted earlier, like HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, or AMQP. The Bounded Context pattern, however,
doesn’t specify whether the Bounded Context is a distributed service or if it’s simply a logical
boundary (such as a generic subsystem) within a monolithic-deployment application.
It’s important to highlight that defining a service for each Bounded Context is a good place to start.
But you don’t have to constrain your design to it. Sometimes you must design a Bounded Context or
29 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

business microservice composed of several physical services. But ultimately, both patterns -Bounded
Context and microservice- are closely related.
DDD benefits from microservices by getting real boundaries in the form of distributed microservices.
But ideas like not sharing the model between microservices are what you also want in a Bounded
Context.

Logical architecture versus physical architecture
It’s useful at this point to stop and discuss the distinction between logical architecture and physical
architecture, and how this applies to the design of microservice-based applications.
To begin, building microservices doesn’t require the use of any specific technology. For instance,
Docker containers aren’t mandatory to create a microservice-based architecture. Those microservices
could also be run as plain processes. Microservices is a logical architecture.
Moreover, even when a microservice could be physically implemented as a single service, process, or
container (for simplicity’s sake, that’s the approach taken in the initial version of eShopOnContainers),
this parity between business microservice and physical service or container isn’t necessarily required in
all cases when you build a large and complex application composed of many dozens or even
hundreds of services.
This is where there’s a difference between an application’s logical architecture and physical
architecture. The logical architecture and logical boundaries of a system do not necessarily map one-
to-one to the physical or deployment architecture. It can happen, but it often doesn’t.
Although you might have identified certain business microservices or Bounded Contexts, it doesn’t
mean that the best way to implement them is always by creating a single service (such as an ASP.NET
Web API) or single Docker container for each business microservice. Having a rule saying each
business microservice has to be implemented using a single service or container is too rigid.
Therefore, a business microservice or Bounded Context is a logical architecture that might coincide (or
not) with physical architecture. The important point is that a business microservice or Bounded
Context must be autonomous by allowing code and state to be independently versioned, deployed,
and scaled.
30 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

As Figure 4-8 shows, the catalog business microservice could be composed of several services or
processes. These could be multiple ASP.NET Web API services or any other kind of services using
HTTP or any other protocol. More importantly, the services could share the same data, as long as
these services are cohesive with respect to the same business domain.
Figure 4-8. Business microservice with several physical services
The services in the example share the same data model because the Web API service targets the same
data as the Search service. So, in the physical implementation of the business microservice, you’re
splitting that functionality so you can scale each of those internal services up or down as needed.
Maybe the Web API service usually needs more instances than the Search service, or vice versa.
In short, the logical architecture of microservices doesn’t always have to coincide with the physical
deployment architecture. In this guide, whenever we mention a microservice, we mean a business or
logical microservice that could map to one or more (physical) services. In most cases, this will be a
single service, but it might be more.
Challenges and solutions for distributed data
management
Challenge #1: How to define the boundaries of each microservice
Defining microservice boundaries is probably the first challenge anyone encounters. Each microservice
has to be a piece of your application and each microservice should be autonomous with all the
benefits and challenges that it conveys. But how do you identify those boundaries?
First, you need to focus on the application’s logical domain models and related data. Try to identify
decoupled islands of data and different contexts within the same application. Each context could have
a different business language (different business terms). The contexts should be defined and managed
independently. The terms and entities that are used in those different contexts might sound similar,
but you might discover that in a particular context, a business concept with one is used for a different
31 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


purpose in another context, and might even have a different name. For instance, a user can be
referred as a user in the identity or membership context, as a customer in a CRM context, as a buyer in
an ordering context, and so forth.
The way you identify boundaries between multiple application contexts with a different domain for
each context is exactly how you can identify the boundaries for each business microservice and its
related domain model and data. You always attempt to minimize the coupling between those
microservices. This guide goes into more detail about this identification and domain model design in
the section Identifying domain-model boundaries for each microservice later.
Challenge #2: How to create queries that retrieve data from several
microservices
A second challenge is how to implement queries that retrieve data from several microservices, while
avoiding chatty communication to the microservices from remote client apps. An example could be a
single screen from a mobile app that needs to show user information that’s owned by the basket,
catalog, and user identity microservices. Another example would be a complex report involving many
tables located in multiple microservices. The right solution depends on the complexity of the queries.
But in any case, you’ll need a way to aggregate information if you want to improve the efficiency in
the communications of your system. The most popular solutions are the following.
API Gateway. For simple data aggregation from multiple microservices that own different databases,
the recommended approach is an aggregation microservice referred to as an API Gateway. However,
you need to be careful about implementing this pattern, because it can be a choke point in your
system, and it can violate the principle of microservice autonomy. To mitigate this possibility, you can
have multiple fined-grained API Gateways each one focusing on a vertical “slice” or business area of
the system. The API Gateway pattern is explained in more detail in the API Gateway section later.
GraphQL Federation One option to consider if your microservices are already using GraphQL is
GraphQL Federation. Federation allows you to define “subgraphs” from other services and compose
them into an aggregate “supergraph” that acts as a standalone schema.
CQRS with query/reads tables. Another solution for aggregating data from multiple microservices is
the Materialized View pattern. In this approach, you generate, in advance (prepare denormalized data
before the actual queries happen), a read-only table with the data that’s owned by multiple
microservices. The table has a format suited to the client app’s needs.
Consider something like the screen for a mobile app. If you have a single database, you might pull
together the data for that screen using a SQL query that performs a complex join involving multiple
tables. However, when you have multiple databases, and each database is owned by a different
microservice, you cannot query those databases and create a SQL join. Your complex query becomes
a challenge. You can address the requirement using a CQRS approach—you create a denormalized
table in a different database that’s used just for queries. The table can be designed specifically for the
data you need for the complex query, with a one-to-one relationship between fields needed by your
application’s screen and the columns in the query table. It could also serve for reporting purposes.
This approach not only solves the original problem (how to query and join across microservices), but it
also improves performance considerably when compared with a complex join, because you already
32 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

have the data that the application needs in the query table. Of course, using Command and Query
Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) with query/reads tables means additional development work, and
you’ll need to embrace eventual consistency. Nonetheless, requirements on performance and high
scalability in collaborative scenarios (or competitive scenarios, depending on the point of view) are
where you should apply CQRS with multiple databases.
“Cold data” in central databases. For complex reports and queries that might not require real-time
data, a common approach is to export your “hot data” (transactional data from the microservices) as
“cold data” into large databases that are used only for reporting. That central database system can be
a Big Data-based system, like Hadoop; a data warehouse like one based on Azure SQL Data
Warehouse; or even a single SQL database that’s used just for reports (if size won’t be an issue).
Keep in mind that this centralized database would be used only for queries and reports that do not
need real-time data. The original updates and transactions, as your source of truth, have to be in your
microservices data. The way you would synchronize data would be either by using event-driven
communication (covered in the next sections) or by using other database infrastructure import/export
tools. If you use event-driven communication, that integration process would be similar to the way
you propagate data as described earlier for CQRS query tables.
However, if your application design involves constantly aggregating information from multiple
microservices for complex queries, it might be a symptom of a bad design -a microservice should be
as isolated as possible from other microservices. (This excludes reports/analytics that always should
use cold-data central databases.) Having this problem often might be a reason to merge
microservices. You need to balance the autonomy of evolution and deployment of each microservice
with strong dependencies, cohesion, and data aggregation.
Challenge #3: How to achieve consistency across multiple
microservices
As stated previously, the data owned by each microservice is private to that microservice and can only
be accessed using its microservice API. Therefore, a challenge presented is how to implement end-to-
end business processes while keeping consistency across multiple microservices.
To analyze this problem, let’s look at an example from the eShopOnContainers reference application.
The Catalog microservice maintains information about all the products, including the product price.
The Basket microservice manages temporal data about product items that users are adding to their
shopping baskets, which includes the price of the items at the time they were added to the basket.
When a product’s price is updated in the catalog, that price should also be updated in the active
baskets that hold that same product, plus the system should probably warn the user saying that a
particular item’s price has changed since they added it to their basket.
In a hypothetical monolithic version of this application, when the price changes in the products table,
the catalog subsystem could simply use an ACID transaction to update the current price in the Basket
table.
However, in a microservices-based application, the Product and Basket tables are owned by their
respective microservices. No microservice should ever include tables/storage owned by another
microservice in its own transactions, not even in direct queries, as shown in Figure 4-9.
33 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

Figure 4-9. A microservice can’t directly access a table in another microservice
The Catalog microservice shouldn’t update the Basket table directly, because the Basket table is
owned by the Basket microservice. To make an update to the Basket microservice, the Catalog
microservice should use eventual consistency probably based on asynchronous communication such
as integration events (message and event-based communication). This is how the eShopOnContainers
reference application performs this type of consistency across microservices.
As stated by the CAP theorem, you need to choose between availability and ACID strong consistency.
Most microservice-based scenarios demand availability and high scalability as opposed to strong
consistency. Mission-critical applications must remain up and running, and developers can work
around strong consistency by using techniques for working with weak or eventual consistency. This is
the approach taken by most microservice-based architectures.
Moreover, ACID-style or two-phase commit transactions are not just against microservices principles;
most NoSQL databases (like Azure Cosmos DB, MongoDB, etc.) do not support two-phase commit
transactions, typical in distributed databases scenarios. However, maintaining data consistency across
services and databases is essential. This challenge is also related to the question of how to propagate
changes across multiple microservices when certain data needs to be redundant—for example, when
you need to have the product’s name or description in the Catalog microservice and the Basket
microservice.
A good solution for this problem is to use eventual consistency between microservices articulated
through event-driven communication and a publish-and-subscribe system. These topics are covered
in the section Asynchronous event-driven communication later in this guide.
34 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


Challenge #4: How to design communication across microservice
boundaries
Communicating across microservice boundaries is a real challenge. In this context, communication
doesn’t refer to what protocol you should use (HTTP and REST, AMQP, messaging, and so on). Instead,
it addresses what communication style you should use, and especially how coupled your
microservices should be. Depending on the level of coupling, when failure occurs, the impact of that
failure on your system will vary significantly.
In a distributed system like a microservices-based application, with so many artifacts moving around
and with distributed services across many servers or hosts, components will eventually fail. Partial
failure and even larger outages will occur, so you need to design your microservices and the
communication across them considering the common risks in this type of distributed system.
A popular approach is to implement HTTP (REST)-based microservices, due to their simplicity. An
HTTP-based approach is perfectly acceptable; the issue here is related to how you use it. If you use
HTTP requests and responses just to interact with your microservices from client applications or from
API Gateways, that’s fine. But if you create long chains of synchronous HTTP calls across microservices,
communicating across their boundaries as if the microservices were objects in a monolithic
application, your application will eventually run into problems.
For instance, imagine that your client application makes an HTTP API call to an individual microservice
like the Ordering microservice. If the Ordering microservice in turn calls additional microservices using
HTTP within the same request/response cycle, you’re creating a chain of HTTP calls. It might sound
reasonable initially. However, there are important points to consider when going down this path:
• Blocking and low performance. Due to the synchronous nature of HTTP, the original request
doesn’t get a response until all the internal HTTP calls are finished. Imagine if the number of
these calls increases significantly and at the same time one of the intermediate HTTP calls to a
microservice is blocked. The result is that performance is impacted, and the overall scalability
will be exponentially affected as additional HTTP requests increase.
• Coupling microservices with HTTP. Business microservices shouldn’t be coupled with other
business microservices. Ideally, they shouldn’t “know” about the existence of other
microservices. If your application relies on coupling microservices as in the example, achieving
autonomy per microservice will be almost impossible.
• Failure in any one microservice. If you implemented a chain of microservices linked by HTTP
calls, when any of the microservices fails (and eventually they will fail) the whole chain of
microservices will fail. A microservice-based system should be designed to continue to work
as well as possible during partial failures. Even if you implement client logic that uses retries
with exponential backoff or circuit breaker mechanisms, the more complex the HTTP call
chains are, the more complex it is to implement a failure strategy based on HTTP.
In fact, if your internal microservices are communicating by creating chains of HTTP requests as
described, it could be argued that you have a monolithic application, but one based on HTTP between
processes instead of intra-process communication mechanisms.
35 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


---

Therefore, in order to enforce microservice autonomy and have better resiliency, you should minimize
the use of chains of request/response communication across microservices. It’s recommended that
you use only asynchronous interaction for inter-microservice communication, either by using
asynchronous message- and event-based communication, or by using (asynchronous) HTTP polling
independently of the original HTTP request/response cycle.
The use of asynchronous communication is explained with additional details later in this guide in the
sections Asynchronous microservice integration enforces microservice’s autonomy and Asynchronous
message-based communication.

Identify domain-model boundaries for each
microservice
The goal when identifying model boundaries and size for each microservice isn’t to get to the most
granular separation possible, although you should tend toward small microservices if possible.
Instead, your goal should be to get to the most meaningful separation guided by your domain
knowledge. The emphasis isn’t on the size, but instead on business capabilities. In addition, if there’s
clear cohesion needed for a certain area of the application based on a high number of dependencies,
that indicates the need for a single microservice, too. Cohesion is a way to identify how to break apart
36 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

or group together microservices. Ultimately, while you gain more knowledge about the domain, you
should adapt the size of your microservice, iteratively. Finding the right size isn’t a one-shot process.
Sam Newman, a recognized promoter of microservices and author of the book Building Microservices,
highlights that you should design your microservices based on the Bounded Context (BC) pattern
(part of domain-driven design), as introduced earlier. Sometimes, a BC could be composed of several
physical services, but not vice versa.
A domain model with specific domain entities applies within a concrete BC or microservice. A BC
delimits the applicability of a domain model and gives developer team members a clear and shared
understanding of what must be cohesive and what can be developed independently. These are the
same goals for microservices.
Another tool that informs your design choice is Conway’s law, which states that an application will
reflect the social boundaries of the organization that produced it. But sometimes the opposite is true -
the company’s organization is formed by the software. You might need to reverse Conway’s law and
build the boundaries the way you want the company to be organized, leaning toward business
process consulting.
To identify bounded contexts, you can use a DDD pattern called the Context Mapping pattern. With
Context Mapping, you identify the various contexts in the application and their boundaries. It’s
common to have a different context and boundary for each small subsystem, for instance. The Context
Map is a way to define and make explicit those boundaries between domains. A BC is autonomous
and includes the details of a single domain -details like the domain entities- and defines integration
contracts with other BCs. This is similar to the definition of a microservice: it’s autonomous, it
implements certain domain capability, and it must provide interfaces. This is why Context Mapping
and the Bounded Context pattern are good approaches for identifying the domain model boundaries
of your microservices.
When designing a large application, you’ll see how its domain model can be fragmented - a domain
expert from the catalog domain will name entities differently in the catalog and inventory domains
than a shipping domain expert, for instance. Or the user domain entity might be different in size and
number of attributes when dealing with a CRM expert who wants to store every detail about the
customer than for an ordering domain expert who just needs partial data about the customer. It’s very
hard to disambiguate all domain terms across all the domains related to a large application. But the
most important thing is that you shouldn’t try to unify the terms. Instead, accept the differences and
richness provided by each domain. If you try to have a unified database for the whole application,
attempts at a unified vocabulary will be awkward and won’t sound right to any of the multiple domain
experts. Therefore, BCs (implemented as microservices) will help you to clarify where you can use
certain domain terms and where you’ll need to split the system and create additional BCs with
different domains.
You’ll know that you got the right boundaries and sizes of each BC and domain model if you have few
strong relationships between domain models, and you do not usually need to merge information
from multiple domain models when performing typical application operations.
Perhaps the best answer to the question of how large a domain model for each microservice should
be is the following: it should have an autonomous BC, as isolated as possible, that enables you to
work without having to constantly switch to other contexts (other microservice’s models). In Figure 4-
37 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

10, you can see how multiple microservices (multiple BCs) each has their own model and how their
entities can be defined, depending on the specific requirements for each of the identified domains in
your application.
Figure 4-10. Identifying entities and microservice model boundaries
Figure 4-10 illustrates a sample scenario related to an online conference management system. The
same entity appears as “Users”, “Buyers”, “Payers”, and “Customers” depending on the bounded
context. You’ve identified several BCs that could be implemented as microservices, based on domains
that domain experts defined for you. As you can see, there are entities that are present just in a single
microservice model, like Payments in the Payment microservice. Those will be easy to implement.
However, you might also have entities that have a different shape but share the same identity across
the multiple domain models from the multiple microservices. For example, the User entity is identified
in the Conferences Management microservice. That same user, with the same identity, is the one
named Buyers in the Ordering microservice, or the one named Payer in the Payment microservice, and
even the one named Customer in the Customer Service microservice. This is because, depending on
the ubiquitous language that each domain expert is using, a user might have a different perspective
even with different attributes. The user entity in the microservice model named Conferences
Management might have most of its personal data attributes. However, that same user in the shape of
Payer in the microservice Payment or in the shape of Customer in the microservice Customer Service
might not need the same list of attributes.
A similar approach is illustrated in Figure 4-11.
38 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


Figure 4-11. Decomposing traditional data models into multiple domain models
When decomposing a traditional data model between bounded contexts, you can have different
entities that share the same identity (a buyer is also a user) with different attributes in each bounded
context. You can see how the user is present in the Conferences Management microservice model as
the User entity and is also present in the form of the Buyer entity in the Pricing microservice, with
alternate attributes or details about the user when it’s actually a buyer. Each microservice or BC might
not need all the data related to a User entity, just part of it, depending on the problem to solve or the
context. For instance, in the Pricing microservice model, you do not need the address or the name of
the user, just the ID (as identity) and Status, which will have an impact on discounts when pricing the
seats per buyer.
The Seat entity has the same name but different attributes in each domain model. However, Seat
shares identity based on the same ID, as happens with User and Buyer.
Basically, there’s a shared concept of a user that exists in multiple services (domains), which all share
the identity of that user. But in each domain model there might be additional or different details
about the user entity. Therefore, there needs to be a way to map a user entity from one domain
(microservice) to another.
There are several benefits to not sharing the same user entity with the same number of attributes
across domains. One benefit is to reduce duplication, so that microservice models do not have any
data that they do not need. Another benefit is having a primary microservice that owns a certain type
of data per entity so that updates and queries for that type of data are driven only by that
microservice.
39 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


The API gateway pattern versus the Direct client-to-
microservice communication
In a microservices architecture, each microservice exposes a set of (typically) fine-grained endpoints.
This fact can impact the client-to-microservice communication, as explained in this section.
Direct client-to-microservice communication
A possible approach is to use a direct client-to-microservice communication architecture. In this
approach, a client app can make requests directly to some of the microservices, as shown in Figure 4-
12.
Figure 4-12. Using a direct client-to-microservice communication architecture
In this approach, each microservice has a public endpoint, sometimes with a different TCP port for
each microservice. An example of a URL for a particular service could be the following URL in Azure:
http://eshoponcontainers.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:88/
In a production environment based on a cluster, that URL would map to the load balancer used in the
cluster, which in turn distributes the requests across the microservices. In production environments,
you could have an Application Delivery Controller (ADC) like Azure Application Gateway between your
microservices and the Internet. This layer acts as a transparent tier that not only performs load
balancing, but secures your services by offering SSL termination. This approach improves the load of
your hosts by offloading CPU-intensive SSL termination and other routing duties to the Azure
Application Gateway. In any case, a load balancer and ADC are transparent from a logical application
architecture point of view.
A direct client-to-microservice communication architecture could be good enough for a small
microservice-based application, especially if the client app is a server-side web application like an
ASP.NET MVC app. However, when you build large and complex microservice-based applications (for
example, when handling dozens of microservice types), and especially when the client apps are
remote mobile apps or SPA web applications, that approach faces a few issues.
40 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


Consider the following questions when developing a large application based on microservices:
• How can client apps minimize the number of requests to the back end and reduce chatty
communication to multiple microservices?
Interacting with multiple microservices to build a single UI screen increases the number of round trips
across the Internet. This approach increases latency and complexity on the UI side. Ideally, responses
should be efficiently aggregated in the server side. This approach reduces latency, since multiple
pieces of data come back in parallel and some UI can show data as soon as it’s ready.
• How can you handle cross-cutting concerns such as authorization, data transformations, and
dynamic request dispatching?
Implementing security and cross-cutting concerns like security and authorization on every
microservice can require significant development effort. A possible approach is to have those services
within the Docker host or internal cluster to restrict direct access to them from the outside, and to
implement those cross-cutting concerns in a centralized place, like an API Gateway.
• How can client apps communicate with services that use non-Internet-friendly protocols?
Protocols used on the server side (like AMQP or binary protocols) are not supported in client apps.
Therefore, requests must be performed through protocols like HTTP/HTTPS and translated to the
other protocols afterwards. A man-in-the-middle approach can help in this situation.
• How can you shape a facade especially made for mobile apps?
The API of multiple microservices might not be well designed for the needs of different client
applications. For instance, the needs of a mobile app might be different than the needs of a web app.
For mobile apps, you might need to optimize even further so that data responses can be more
efficient. You might do this functionality by aggregating data from multiple microservices and
returning a single set of data, and sometimes eliminating any data in the response that isn’t needed
by the mobile app. And, of course, you might compress that data. Again, a facade or API in between
the mobile app and the microservices can be convenient for this scenario.
Why consider API Gateways instead of direct client-to-microservice
communication
In a microservices architecture, the client apps usually need to consume functionality from more than
one microservice. If that consumption is performed directly, the client needs to handle multiple calls
to microservice endpoints. What happens when the application evolves and new microservices are
introduced or existing microservices are updated? If your application has many microservices,
handling so many endpoints from the client apps can be a nightmare. Since the client app would be
coupled to those internal endpoints, evolving the microservices in the future can cause high impact
for the client apps.
Therefore, having an intermediate level or tier of indirection (Gateway) can be convenient for
microservice-based applications. If you don’t have API Gateways, the client apps must send requests
directly to the microservices and that raises problems, such as the following issues:
41 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

• Coupling: Without the API Gateway pattern, the client apps are coupled to the internal
microservices. The client apps need to know how the multiple areas of the application are
decomposed in microservices. When evolving and refactoring the internal microservices,
those actions impact maintenance because they cause breaking changes to the client apps
due to the direct reference to the internal microservices from the client apps. Client apps need
to be updated frequently, making the solution harder to evolve.
• Too many round trips: A single page/screen in the client app might require several calls to
multiple services. That approach can result in multiple network round trips between the client
and the server, adding significant latency. Aggregation handled in an intermediate level could
improve the performance and user experience for the client app.
• Security issues: Without a gateway, all the microservices must be exposed to the “external
world”, making the attack surface larger than if you hide internal microservices that aren’t
directly used by the client apps. The smaller the attack surface is, the more secure your
application can be.
• Cross-cutting concerns: Each publicly published microservice must handle concerns such as
authorization and SSL. In many situations, those concerns could be handled in a single tier so
the internal microservices are simplified.
What is the API Gateway pattern?
When you design and build large or complex microservice-based applications with multiple client
apps, a good approach to consider can be an API Gateway. This pattern is a service that provides a
single-entry point for certain groups of microservices. It’s similar to the Facade pattern from object-
oriented design, but in this case, it’s part of a distributed system. The API Gateway pattern is also
sometimes known as the “backend for frontend” (BFF) because you build it while thinking about the
needs of the client app.
Therefore, the API gateway sits between the client apps and the microservices. It acts as a reverse
proxy, routing requests from clients to services. It can also provide other cross-cutting features such
as authentication, SSL termination, and cache.
Figure 4-13 shows how a custom API Gateway can fit into a simplified microservice-based architecture
with just a few microservices.
42 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

Figure 4-13. Using an API Gateway implemented as a custom service
Apps connect to a single endpoint, the API Gateway, that’s configured to forward requests to
individual microservices. In this example, the API Gateway would be implemented as a custom
ASP.NET Core WebHost service running as a container.
It’s important to highlight that in that diagram, you would be using a single custom API Gateway
service facing multiple and different client apps. That fact can be an important risk because your API
Gateway service will be growing and evolving based on many different requirements from the client
apps. Eventually, it will be bloated because of those different needs and effectively it could be similar
to a monolithic application or monolithic service. That’s why it’s very much recommended to split the
API Gateway in multiple services or multiple smaller API Gateways, one per client app form-factor
type, for instance.
You need to be careful when implementing the API Gateway pattern. Usually it isn’t a good idea to
have a single API Gateway aggregating all the internal microservices of your application. If it does, it
acts as a monolithic aggregator or orchestrator and violates microservice autonomy by coupling all
the microservices.
Therefore, the API Gateways should be segregated based on business boundaries and the client apps
and not act as a single aggregator for all the internal microservices.
When splitting the API Gateway tier into multiple API Gateways, if your application has multiple client
apps, that can be a primary pivot when identifying the multiple API Gateways types, so that you can
have a different facade for the needs of each client app. This case is a pattern named “Backend for
Frontend” (BFF) where each API Gateway can provide a different API tailored for each client app type,
possibly even based on the client form factor by implementing specific adapter code which
underneath calls multiple internal microservices, as shown in the following image:
43 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


Figure 4-13.1. Using multiple custom API Gateways
Figure 4-13.1 shows API Gateways that are segregated by client type; one for mobile clients and one
for web clients. A traditional web app connects to an MVC microservice that uses the web API
Gateway. The example depicts a simplified architecture with multiple fine-grained API Gateways. In
this case, the boundaries identified for each API Gateway are based purely on the “Backend for
Frontend” (BFF) pattern, hence based just on the API needed per client app. But in larger applications
you should also go further and create other API Gateways based on business boundaries as a second
design pivot.
Main features in the API Gateway pattern
An API Gateway can offer multiple features. Depending on the product it might offer richer or simpler
features, however, the most important and foundational features for any API Gateway are the
following design patterns:
Reverse proxy or gateway routing. The API Gateway offers a reverse proxy to redirect or route
requests (layer 7 routing, usually HTTP requests) to the endpoints of the internal microservices. The
gateway provides a single endpoint or URL for the client apps and then internally maps the requests
to a group of internal microservices. This routing feature helps to decouple the client apps from the
microservices but it’s also convenient when modernizing a monolithic API by sitting the API Gateway
in between the monolithic API and the client apps, then you can add new APIs as new microservices
while still using the legacy monolithic API until it’s split into many microservices in the future. Because
of the API Gateway, the client apps won’t notice if the APIs being used are implemented as internal
microservices or a monolithic API and more importantly, when evolving and refactoring the
monolithic API into microservices, thanks to the API Gateway routing, client apps won’t be impacted
with any URI change.
44 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


For more information, see Gateway routing pattern.
Requests aggregation. As part of the gateway pattern you can aggregate multiple client requests
(usually HTTP requests) targeting multiple internal microservices into a single client request. This
pattern is especially convenient when a client page/screen needs information from several
microservices. With this approach, the client app sends a single request to the API Gateway that
dispatches several requests to the internal microservices and then aggregates the results and sends
everything back to the client app. The main benefit and goal of this design pattern is to reduce
chattiness between the client apps and the backend API, which is especially important for remote
apps out of the datacenter where the microservices live, like mobile apps or requests coming from
SPA apps that come from JavaScript in client remote browsers. For regular web apps performing the
requests in the server environment (like an ASP.NET Core MVC web app), this pattern is not so
important as the latency is very much smaller than for remote client apps.
Depending on the API Gateway product you use, it might be able to perform this aggregation.
However, in many cases it’s more flexible to create aggregation microservices under the scope of the
API Gateway, so you define the aggregation in code (that is, C# code):
For more information, see Gateway aggregation pattern.
Cross-cutting concerns or gateway offloading. Depending on the features offered by each API
Gateway product, you can offload functionality from individual microservices to the gateway, which
simplifies the implementation of each microservice by consolidating cross-cutting concerns into one
tier. This approach is especially convenient for specialized features that can be complex to implement
properly in every internal microservice, such as the following functionality:
• Authentication and authorization
• Service discovery integration
• Response caching
• Retry policies, circuit breaker, and QoS
• Rate limiting and throttling
• Load balancing
• Logging, tracing, correlation
• Headers, query strings, and claims transformation
• IP allowlisting
For more information, see Gateway offloading pattern.
Using products with API Gateway features
There can be many more cross-cutting concerns offered by the API Gateways products depending on
each implementation. We’ll explore here:
• Azure API Management
• Ocelot
45 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


---

Azure API Management
Azure API Management (as shown in Figure 4-14) not only solves your API Gateway needs but
provides features like gathering insights from your APIs. If you’re using an API management solution,
an API Gateway is only a component within that full API management solution.
Figure 4-14. Using Azure API Management for your API Gateway
Azure API Management solves both your API Gateway and Management needs like logging, security,
metering, etc. In this case, when using a product like Azure API Management, the fact that you might
have a single API Gateway is not so risky because these kinds of API Gateways are “thinner”, meaning
that you don’t implement custom C# code that could evolve towards a monolithic component.
The API Gateway products usually act like a reverse proxy for ingress communication, where you can
also filter the APIs from the internal microservices plus apply authorization to the published APIs in
this single tier.
The insights available from an API Management system help you get an understanding of how your
APIs are being used and how they are performing. They do this activity by letting you view near real-
time analytics reports and identifying trends that might impact your business. Plus, you can have logs
about request and response activity for further online and offline analysis.
With Azure API Management, you can secure your APIs using a key, a token, and IP filtering. These
features let you enforce flexible and fine-grained quotas and rate limits, modify the shape and
behavior of your APIs using policies, and improve performance with response caching.
In this guide and the reference sample application (eShopOnContainers), the architecture is limited to
a simpler and custom-made containerized architecture in order to focus on plain containers without
46 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


using PaaS products like Azure API Management. But for large microservice-based applications that
are deployed into Microsoft Azure, we encourage you to evaluate Azure API Management as the base
for your API Gateways in production.
Ocelot
Ocelot is a lightweight API Gateway, recommended for simpler approaches. Ocelot is an Open Source
.NET Core-based API Gateway especially made for microservices architectures that need unified points
of entry into their systems. It’s lightweight, fast, and scalable and provides routing and authentication
among many other features.
The main reason to choose Ocelot for the eShopOnContainers reference application 2.0 is because
Ocelot is a .NET Core lightweight API Gateway that you can deploy into the same application
deployment environment where you’re deploying your microservices/containers, such as a Docker
Host, Kubernetes, etc. And since it’s based on .NET Core, it’s cross-platform allowing you to deploy on
Linux or Windows.
The previous diagrams showing custom API Gateways running in containers are precisely how you can
also run Ocelot in a container and microservice-based application.
In addition, there are many other products in the market offering API Gateways features, such as
Apigee, Kong, MuleSoft, WSO2, and other products like Linkerd and Istio for service mesh ingress
controller features.
After the initial architecture and patterns explanation sections, the next sections explain how to
implement API Gateways with Ocelot.
Drawbacks of the API Gateway pattern
• The most important drawback is that when you implement an API Gateway, you’re coupling
that tier with the internal microservices. Coupling like this might introduce serious difficulties
for your application. Clemens Vaster, architect at the Azure Service Bus team, refers to this
potential difficulty as “the new ESB” in the “Messaging and Microservices” session at GOTO
2016.
• Using a microservices API Gateway creates an additional possible single point of failure.
• An API Gateway can introduce increased response time due to the additional network call.
However, this extra call usually has less impact than having a client interface that’s too chatty
directly calling the internal microservices.
• If not scaled out properly, the API Gateway can become a bottleneck.
• An API Gateway requires additional development cost and future maintenance if it includes
custom logic and data aggregation. Developers must update the API Gateway in order to
expose each microservice’s endpoints. Moreover, implementation changes in the internal
microservices might cause code changes at the API Gateway level. However, if the API
Gateway is just applying security, logging, and versioning (as when using Azure API
Management), this additional development cost might not apply.
47 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

• If the API Gateway is developed by a single team, there can be a development bottleneck. This
aspect is another reason why a better approach is to have several fined-grained API Gateways
that respond to different client needs. You could also segregate the API Gateway internally
into multiple areas or layers that are owned by the different teams working on the internal
microservices.

Communication in a microservice architecture
In a monolithic application running on a single process, components invoke one another using
language-level method or function calls. These can be strongly coupled if you’re creating objects with
code (for example, new ClassName()), or can be invoked in a decoupled way if you’re using
Dependency Injection by referencing abstractions rather than concrete object instances. Either way,
the objects are running within the same process. The biggest challenge when changing from a
monolithic application to a microservices-based application lies in changing the communication
mechanism. A direct conversion from in-process method calls into RPC calls to services will cause a
chatty and not efficient communication that won’t perform well in distributed environments. The
challenges of designing distributed system properly are well enough known that there’s even a canon
known as the Fallacies of distributed computing that lists assumptions that developers often make
when moving from monolithic to distributed designs.
There isn’t one solution, but several. One solution involves isolating the business microservices as
much as possible. You then use asynchronous communication between the internal microservices and
replace fine-grained communication that’s typical in intra-process communication between objects
with coarser-grained communication. You can do this by grouping calls, and by returning data that
aggregates the results of multiple internal calls, to the client.
48 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

A microservices-based application is a distributed system running on multiple processes or services,
usually even across multiple servers or hosts. Each service instance is typically a process. Therefore,
services must interact using an inter-process communication protocol such as HTTP, AMQP, or a
binary protocol like TCP, depending on the nature of each service.
The microservice community promotes the philosophy of “smart endpoints and dumb pipes”. This
slogan encourages a design that’s as decoupled as possible between microservices, and as cohesive
as possible within a single microservice. As explained earlier, each microservice owns its own data and
its own domain logic. But the microservices composing an end-to-end application are usually simply
choreographed by using REST communications rather than complex protocols such as WS-* and
flexible event-driven communications instead of centralized business-process-orchestrators.
The two commonly used protocols are HTTP request/response with resource APIs (when querying
most of all), and lightweight asynchronous messaging when communicating updates across multiple
microservices. These are explained in more detail in the following sections.
Communication types
Client and services can communicate through many different types of communication, each one
targeting a different scenario and goals. Initially, those types of communications can be classified in
two axes.
The first axis defines if the protocol is synchronous or asynchronous:
• Synchronous protocol. HTTP is a synchronous protocol. The client sends a request and waits
for a response from the service. That’s independent of the client code execution that could be
synchronous (thread is blocked) or asynchronous (thread isn’t blocked, and the response will
reach a callback eventually). The important point here is that the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) is
synchronous and the client code can only continue its task when it receives the HTTP server
response.
• Asynchronous protocol. Other protocols like AMQP (a protocol supported by many operating
systems and cloud environments) use asynchronous messages. The client code or message
sender usually doesn’t wait for a response. It just sends the message as when sending a
message to a RabbitMQ queue or any other message broker.
The second axis defines if the communication has a single receiver or multiple receivers:
• Single receiver. Each request must be processed by exactly one receiver or service. An
example of this communication is the Command pattern.
• Multiple receivers. Each request can be processed by zero to multiple receivers. This type of
communication must be asynchronous. An example is the publish/subscribe mechanism used
in patterns like Event-driven architecture. This is based on an event-bus interface or message
broker when propagating data updates between multiple microservices through events; it’s
usually implemented through a service bus or similar artifact like Azure Service Bus by using
topics and subscriptions.
49 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

A microservice-based application will often use a combination of these communication styles. The
most common type is single-receiver communication with a synchronous protocol like HTTP/HTTPS
when invoking a regular Web API HTTP service. Microservices also typically use messaging protocols
for asynchronous communication between microservices.
These axes are good to know so you have clarity on the possible communication mechanisms, but
they’re not the important concerns when building microservices. Neither the asynchronous nature of
client thread execution nor the asynchronous nature of the selected protocol are the important points
when integrating microservices. What is important is being able to integrate your microservices
asynchronously while maintaining the independence of microservices, as explained in the following
section.
Asynchronous microservice integration enforces microservice’s
autonomy
As mentioned, the important point when building a microservices-based application is the way you
integrate your microservices. Ideally, you should try to minimize the communication between the
internal microservices. The fewer communications between microservices, the better. But in many
cases, you’ll have to somehow integrate the microservices. When you need to do that, the critical rule
here is that the communication between the microservices should be asynchronous. That doesn’t
mean that you have to use a specific protocol (for example, asynchronous messaging versus
synchronous HTTP). It just means that the communication between microservices should be done only
by propagating data asynchronously, but try not to depend on other internal microservices as part of
the initial service’s HTTP request/response operation.
If possible, never depend on synchronous communication (request/response) between multiple
microservices, not even for queries. The goal of each microservice is to be autonomous and available
to the client consumer, even if the other services that are part of the end-to-end application are down
or unhealthy. If you think you need to make a call from one microservice to other microservices (like
performing an HTTP request for a data query) to be able to provide a response to a client application,
you have an architecture that won’t be resilient when some microservices fail.
Moreover, having HTTP dependencies between microservices, like when creating long
request/response cycles with HTTP request chains, as shown in the first part of the Figure 4-15, not
only makes your microservices not autonomous but also their performance is impacted as soon as
one of the services in that chain isn’t performing well.
The more you add synchronous dependencies between microservices, such as query requests, the
worse the overall response time gets for the client apps.
50 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

Figure 4-15. Anti-patterns and patterns in communication between microservices
As shown in the above diagram, in synchronous communication a “chain” of requests is created
between microservices while serving the client request. This is an anti-pattern. In asynchronous
communication microservices use asynchronous messages or http polling to communicate with other
microservices, but the client request is served right away.
If your microservice needs to raise an additional action in another microservice, if possible, do not
perform that action synchronously and as part of the original microservice request and reply
operation. Instead, do it asynchronously (using asynchronous messaging or integration events,
queues, etc.). But, as much as possible, do not invoke the action synchronously as part of the original
synchronous request and reply operation.
And finally (and this is where most of the issues arise when building microservices), if your initial
microservice needs data that’s originally owned by other microservices, do not rely on making
synchronous requests for that data. Instead, replicate or propagate that data (only the attributes you
need) into the initial service’s database by using eventual consistency (typically by using integration
events, as explained in upcoming sections).
As noted earlier in the Identifying domain-model boundaries for each microservice section,
duplicating some data across several microservices isn’t an incorrect design—on the contrary, when
doing that you can translate the data into the specific language or terms of that additional domain or
Bounded Context. For instance, in the eShopOnContainers application you have a microservice named
identity-api that’s in charge of most of the user’s data with an entity named User. However, when you
need to store data about the user within the Ordering microservice, you store it as a different entity
named Buyer. The Buyer entity shares the same identity with the original User entity, but it might have
only the few attributes needed by the Ordering domain, and not the whole user profile.
51 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


You might use any protocol to communicate and propagate data asynchronously across microservices
in order to have eventual consistency. As mentioned, you could use integration events using an event
bus or message broker or you could even use HTTP by polling the other services instead. It doesn’t
matter. The important rule is to not create synchronous dependencies between your microservices.
The following sections explain the multiple communication styles you can consider using in a
microservice-based application.
Communication styles
There are many protocols and choices you can use for communication, depending on the
communication type you want to use. If you’re using a synchronous request/response-based
communication mechanism, protocols such as HTTP and REST approaches are the most common,
especially if you’re publishing your services outside the Docker host or microservice cluster. If you’re
communicating between services internally (within your Docker host or microservices cluster), you
might also want to use binary format communication mechanisms (like WCF using TCP and binary
format). Alternatively, you can use asynchronous, message-based communication mechanisms such as
AMQP.
There are also multiple message formats like JSON or XML, or even binary formats, which can be more
efficient. If your chosen binary format isn’t a standard, it’s probably not a good idea to publicly
publish your services using that format. You could use a non-standard format for internal
communication between your microservices. You might do this when communicating between
microservices within your Docker host or microservice cluster (for example, Docker orchestrators), or
for proprietary client applications that talk to the microservices.
Request/response communication with HTTP and REST
When a client uses request/response communication, it sends a request to a service, then the service
processes the request and sends back a response. Request/response communication is especially well
suited for querying data for a real-time UI (a live user interface) from client apps. Therefore, in a
microservice architecture you’ll probably use this communication mechanism for most queries, as
shown in Figure 4-16.
Figure 4-16. Using HTTP request/response communication (synchronous or asynchronous)
52 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


When a client uses request/response communication, it assumes that the response will arrive in a
short time, typically less than a second, or a few seconds at most. For delayed responses, you need to
implement asynchronous communication based on messaging patterns and messaging technologies,
which is a different approach that we explain in the next section.
A popular architectural style for request/response communication is REST. This approach is based on,
and tightly coupled to, the HTTP protocol, embracing HTTP verbs like GET, POST, and PUT. REST is the
most commonly used architectural communication approach when creating services. You can
implement REST services when you develop ASP.NET Core Web API services.
There’s additional value when using HTTP REST services as your interface definition language. For
instance, if you use Swagger metadata to describe your service API, you can use tools that generate
client stubs that can directly discover and consume your services.

https://swagger.io/
Push and real-time communication based on HTTP
Another possibility (usually for different purposes than REST) is a real-time and one-to-many
communication with higher-level frameworks such as ASP.NET SignalR and protocols such as
WebSockets.
As Figure 4-17 shows, real-time HTTP communication means that you can have server code pushing
content to connected clients as the data becomes available, rather than having the server wait for a
client to request new data.
53 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

Figure 4-17. One-to-many real-time asynchronous message communication
SignalR is a good way to achieve real-time communication for pushing content to the clients from a
back-end server. Since communication is in real time, client apps show the changes almost instantly.
This is usually handled by a protocol such as WebSockets, using many WebSockets connections (one
per client). A typical example is when a service communicates a change in the score of a sports game
to many client web apps simultaneously.
Asynchronous message-based communication
Asynchronous messaging and event-driven communication are critical when propagating changes
across multiple microservices and their related domain models. As mentioned earlier in the discussion
microservices and Bounded Contexts (BCs), models (User, Customer, Product, Account, etc.) can mean
different things to different microservices or BCs. That means that when changes occur, you need
some way to reconcile changes across the different models. A solution is eventual consistency and
event-driven communication based on asynchronous messaging.
When using messaging, processes communicate by exchanging messages asynchronously. A client
makes a command or a request to a service by sending it a message. If the service needs to reply, it
sends a different message back to the client. Since it’s a message-based communication, the client
assumes that the reply won’t be received immediately, and that there might be no response at all.
A message is composed by a header (metadata such as identification or security information) and a
body. Messages are usually sent through asynchronous protocols like AMQP.
The preferred infrastructure for this type of communication in the microservices community is a
lightweight message broker, which is different than the large brokers and orchestrators used in SOA.
In a lightweight message broker, the infrastructure is typically “dumb,” acting only as a message
broker, with simple implementations such as RabbitMQ or a scalable service bus in the cloud like
54 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


Azure Service Bus. In this scenario, most of the “smart” thinking still lives in the endpoints that are
producing and consuming messages-that is, in the microservices.
Another rule you should try to follow, as much as possible, is to use only asynchronous messaging
between the internal services, and to use synchronous communication (such as HTTP) only from the
client apps to the front-end services (API Gateways plus the first level of microservices).
There are two kinds of asynchronous messaging communication: single receiver message-based
communication, and multiple receivers message-based communication. The following sections
provide details about them.
Single-receiver message-based communication
Message-based asynchronous communication with a single receiver means there’s point-to-point
communication that delivers a message to exactly one of the consumers that’s reading from the
channel, and that the message is processed just once. However, there are special situations. For
instance, in a cloud system that tries to automatically recover from failures, the same message could
be sent multiple times. Due to network or other failures, the client has to be able to retry sending
messages, and the server has to implement an operation to be idempotent in order to process a
particular message just once.
Single-receiver message-based communication is especially well suited for sending asynchronous
commands from one microservice to another as shown in Figure 4-18 that illustrates this approach.
Once you start sending message-based communication (either with commands or events), you should
avoid mixing message-based communication with synchronous HTTP communication.
Figure 4-18. A single microservice receiving an asynchronous message
55 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications



---

When the commands come from client applications, they can be implemented as HTTP synchronous
commands. Use message-based commands when you need higher scalability or when you’re already
in a message-based business process.
Multiple-receivers message-based communication
As a more flexible approach, you might also want to use a publish/subscribe mechanism so that your
communication from the sender will be available to additional subscriber microservices or to external
applications. Thus, it helps you to follow the open/closed principle in the sending service. That way,
additional subscribers can be added in the future without the need to modify the sender service.
When you use a publish/subscribe communication, you might be using an event bus interface to
publish events to any subscriber.
Asynchronous event-driven communication
When using asynchronous event-driven communication, a microservice publishes an integration event
when something happens within its domain and another microservice needs to be aware of it, like a
price change in a product catalog microservice. Additional microservices subscribe to the events so
they can receive them asynchronously. When that happens, the receivers might update their own
domain entities, which can cause more integration events to be published. This publish/subscribe
system is performed by using an implementation of an event bus. The event bus can be designed as
an abstraction or interface, with the API that’s needed to subscribe or unsubscribe to events and to
publish events. The event bus can also have one or more implementations based on any inter-process
and messaging broker, like a messaging queue or service bus that supports asynchronous
communication and a publish/subscribe model.
If a system uses eventual consistency driven by integration events, it’s recommended that this
approach is made clear to the end user. The system shouldn’t use an approach that mimics
integration events, like SignalR or polling systems from the client. The end user and the business
owner have to explicitly embrace eventual consistency in the system and realize that in many cases
the business doesn’t have any problem with this approach, as long as it’s explicit. This approach is
important because users might expect to see some results immediately and this aspect might not
happen with eventual consistency.
As noted earlier in the Challenges and solutions for distributed data management section, you can use
integration events to implement business tasks that span multiple microservices. Thus, you’ll have
eventual consistency between those services. An eventually consistent transaction is made up of a
collection of distributed actions. At each action, the related microservice updates a domain entity and
publishes another integration event that raises the next action within the same end-to-end business
task.
An important point is that you might want to communicate to multiple microservices that are
subscribed to the same event. To do so, you can use publish/subscribe messaging based on event-
driven communication, as shown in Figure 4-19. This publish/subscribe mechanism isn’t exclusive to
the microservice architecture. It’s similar to the way Bounded Contexts in DDD should communicate,
or to the way you propagate updates from the write database to the read database in the Command
56 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) architecture pattern. The goal is to have eventual
consistency between multiple data sources across your distributed system.
Figure 4-19. Asynchronous event-driven message communication
In asynchronous event-driven communication, one microservice publishes events to an event bus and
many microservices can subscribe to it, to get notified and act on it. Your implementation will
determine what protocol to use for event-driven, message-based communications. AMQP can help
achieve reliable queued communication.
When you use an event bus, you might want to use an abstraction level (like an event bus interface)
based on a related implementation in classes with code using the API from a message broker like
RabbitMQ or a service bus like Azure Service Bus with Topics. Alternatively, you might want to use a
higher-level service bus like NServiceBus, MassTransit, or Brighter to articulate your event bus and
publish/subscribe system.
A note about messaging technologies for production systems
The messaging technologies available for implementing your abstract event bus are at different levels.
For instance, products like RabbitMQ (a messaging broker transport) and Azure Service Bus sit at a
lower level than other products like NServiceBus, MassTransit, or Brighter, which can work on top of
RabbitMQ and Azure Service Bus. Your choice depends on how many rich features at the application
level and out-of-the-box scalability you need for your application. For implementing just a proof-of-
concept event bus for your development environment, as it was done in the eShopOnContainers
sample, a simple implementation on top of RabbitMQ running on a Docker container might be
enough.
However, for mission-critical and production systems that need hyper-scalability, you might want to
evaluate Azure Service Bus. For high-level abstractions and features that make the development of
distributed applications easier, we recommend that you evaluate other commercial and open-source
service buses, such as NServiceBus, MassTransit, and Brighter. Of course, you can build your own
57 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


service-bus features on top of lower-level technologies like RabbitMQ and Docker. But that plumbing
work might cost too much for a custom enterprise application.
Resiliently publishing to the event bus
A challenge when implementing an event-driven architecture across multiple microservices is how to
atomically update state in the original microservice while resiliently publishing its related integration
event into the event bus, somehow based on transactions. The following are a few ways to accomplish
this functionality, although there could be additional approaches as well.
• Using a transactional (DTC-based) queue like MSMQ. (However, this is a legacy approach.)
• Using transaction log mining.
• Using full Event Sourcing pattern.
• Using the Outbox pattern: a transactional database table as a message queue that will be the
base for an event-creator component that would create the event and publish it.
For a more complete description of the challenges in this space, including how messages with
potentially incorrect data can end up being published, see Data platform for mission-critical
workloads on Azure: Every message must be processed.
Additional topics to consider when using asynchronous communication are message idempotence
and message deduplication. These topics are covered in the section Implementing event-based
communication between microservices (integration events) later in this guide.

Creating, evolving, and versioning microservice APIs
and contracts
A microservice API is a contract between the service and its clients. You’ll be able to evolve a
microservice independently only if you do not break its API contract, which is why the contract is so
important. If you change the contract, it will impact your client applications or your API Gateway.
The nature of the API definition depends on which protocol you’re using. For instance, if you’re using
messaging, like AMQP, the API consists of the message types. If you’re using HTTP and RESTful
services, the API consists of the URLs and the request and response JSON formats.
However, even if you’re thoughtful about your initial contract, a service API will need to change over
time. When that happens—and especially if your API is a public API consumed by multiple client
applications — you typically can’t force all clients to upgrade to your new API contract. You usually
need to incrementally deploy new versions of a service in a way that both old and new versions of a
service contract are running simultaneously. Therefore, it’s important to have a strategy for your
service versioning.
When the API changes are small, like if you add attributes or parameters to your API, clients that use
an older API should switch and work with the new version of the service. You might be able to provide
default values for any missing attributes that are required, and the clients might be able to ignore any
extra response attributes.
However, sometimes you need to make major and incompatible changes to a service API. Because
you might not be able to force client applications or services to upgrade immediately to the new
version, a service must support older versions of the API for some period. If you’re using an HTTP-
based mechanism such as REST, one approach is to embed the API version number in the URL or into
an HTTP header. Then you can decide between implementing both versions of the service
simultaneously within the same service instance, or deploying different instances that each handle a
version of the API. A good approach for this functionality is the Mediator pattern (for example,
MediatR library) to decouple the different implementation versions into independent handlers.
Finally, if you’re using a REST architecture, Hypermedia is the best solution for versioning your services
and allowing evolvable APIs.

Microservices addressability and the service registry
Each microservice has a unique name (URL) that’s used to resolve its location. Your microservice needs
to be addressable wherever it’s running. If you have to think about which computer is running a
particular microservice, things can go bad quickly. In the same way that DNS resolves a URL to a
particular computer, your microservice needs to have a unique name so that its current location is
discoverable. Microservices need addressable names that make them independent from the
infrastructure that they’re running on. This approach implies that there’s an interaction between how
your service is deployed and how it’s discovered, because there needs to be a service registry. In the
same vein, when a computer fails, the registry service must be able to indicate where the service is
now running.
The service registry pattern is a key part of service discovery. The registry is a database containing the
network locations of service instances. A service registry needs to be highly available and up-to-date.
Clients could cache network locations obtained from the service registry. However, that information
eventually goes out of date and clients can no longer discover service instances. So, a service registry
consists of a cluster of servers that use a replication protocol to maintain consistency.
In some microservice deployment environments (called clusters, to be covered in a later section),
service discovery is built in. For example, an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) environment can handle
service instance registration and deregistration. It also runs a proxy on each cluster host that plays the
role of server-side discovery router.

Creating composite UI based on microservices
Microservices architecture often starts with the server-side handling data and logic, but, in many
cases, the UI is still handled as a monolith. However, a more advanced approach, called micro
frontends, is to design your application UI based on microservices as well. That means having a
composite UI produced by the microservices, instead of having microservices on the server and just a
monolithic client app consuming the microservices. With this approach, the microservices you build
can be complete with both logic and visual representation.
Figure 4-20 shows the simpler approach of just consuming microservices from a monolithic client
application. Of course, you could have an ASP.NET MVC service in between producing the HTML and
JavaScript. The figure is a simplification that highlights that you have a single (monolithic) client UI
60 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

consuming the microservices, which just focus on logic and data and not on the UI shape (HTML and
JavaScript).
Figure 4-20. A monolithic UI application consuming back-end microservices
In contrast, a composite UI is precisely generated and composed by the microservices themselves.
Some of the microservices drive the visual shape of specific areas of the UI. The key difference is that
you have client UI components (TypeScript classes, for example) based on templates, and the data-
shaping-UI ViewModel for those templates comes from each microservice.
At client application start-up time, each of the client UI components (TypeScript classes, for example)
registers itself with an infrastructure microservice capable of providing ViewModels for a given
scenario. If the microservice changes the shape, the UI changes also.
Figure 4-21 shows a version of this composite UI approach. This approach is simplified because you
might have other microservices that are aggregating granular parts that are based on different
techniques. It depends on whether you’re building a traditional web approach (ASP.NET MVC) or an
SPA (Single Page Application).
61 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


Figure 4-21. Example of a composite UI application shaped by back-end microservices
Each of those UI composition microservices would be similar to a small API Gateway. But in this case,
each one is responsible for a small UI area.
A composite UI approach that’s driven by microservices can be more challenging or less so,
depending on what UI technologies you’re using. For instance, you won’t use the same techniques for
building a traditional web application that you use for building an SPA or for native mobile app (as
when developing Xamarin apps, which can be more challenging for this approach).
The eShopOnContainers sample application uses the monolithic UI approach for multiple reasons.
First, it’s an introduction to microservices and containers. A composite UI is more advanced but also
requires further complexity when designing and developing the UI. Second, eShopOnContainers also
provides a native mobile app based on Xamarin, which would make it more complex on the client C#
side.
However, we encourage you to use the following references to learn more about composite UI based
on microservices.

Resiliency and high availability in microservices
Dealing with unexpected failures is one of the hardest problems to solve, especially in a distributed
system. Much of the code that developers write involves handling exceptions, and this is also where
the most time is spent in testing. The problem is more involved than writing code to handle failures.
What happens when the machine where the microservice is running fails? Not only do you need to
detect this microservice failure (a hard problem on its own), but you also need something to restart
your microservice.
A microservice needs to be resilient to failures and to be able to restart often on another machine for
availability. This resiliency also comes down to the state that was saved on behalf of the microservice,
where the microservice can recover this state from, and whether the microservice can restart
successfully. In other words, there needs to be resiliency in the compute capability (the process can
restart at any time) as well as resilience in the state or data (no data loss, and the data remains
consistent).
The problems of resiliency are compounded during other scenarios, such as when failures occur
during an application upgrade. The microservice, working with the deployment system, needs to
determine whether it can continue to move forward to the newer version or instead roll back to a
previous version to maintain a consistent state. Questions such as whether enough machines are
available to keep moving forward and how to recover previous versions of the microservice need to
be considered. This approach requires the microservice to emit health information so that the overall
application and orchestrator can make these decisions.
In addition, resiliency is related to how cloud-based systems must behave. As mentioned, a cloud-
based system must embrace failures and must try to automatically recover from them. For instance, in
case of network or container failures, client apps or client services must have a strategy to retry
sending messages or to retry requests, since in many cases failures in the cloud are partial. The
Implementing Resilient Applications section in this guide addresses how to handle partial failure. It
describes techniques like retries with exponential backoff or the Circuit Breaker pattern in .NET by
using libraries like Polly, which offers a large variety of policies to handle this subject.
Health management and diagnostics in microservices
It may seem obvious, and it’s often overlooked, but a microservice must report its health and
diagnostics. Otherwise, there’s little insight from an operations perspective. Correlating diagnostic
events across a set of independent services and dealing with machine clock skews to make sense of
63 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

the event order is challenging. In the same way that you interact with a microservice over agreed-
upon protocols and data formats, there’s a need for standardization in how to log health and
diagnostic events that ultimately end up in an event store for querying and viewing. In a microservices
approach, it’s key that different teams agree on a single logging format. There needs to be a
consistent approach to viewing diagnostic events in the application.
Health checks
Health is different from diagnostics. Health is about the microservice reporting its current state to take
appropriate actions. A good example is working with upgrade and deployment mechanisms to
maintain availability. Although a service might currently be unhealthy due to a process crash or
machine reboot, the service might still be operational. The last thing you need is to make this worse
by performing an upgrade. The best approach is to do an investigation first or allow time for the
microservice to recover. Health events from a microservice help us make informed decisions and, in
effect, help create self-healing services.
In the Implementing health checks in ASP.NET Core services section of this guide, we explain how to
use a new ASP.NET HealthChecks library in your microservices so they can report their state to a
monitoring service to take appropriate actions.
You also have the option of using an excellent open-source library called
AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks, available on GitHub and as a NuGet package. This library also
does health checks, with a twist, it handles two types of checks:
• Liveness: Checks if the microservice is alive, that is, if it’s able to accept requests and respond.
• Readiness: Checks if the microservice’s dependencies (Database, queue services, etc.) are
themselves ready, so the microservice can do what it’s supposed to do.
Using diagnostics and logs event streams
Logs provide information about how an application or service is running, including exceptions,
warnings, and simple informational messages. Usually, each log is in a text format with one line per
event, although exceptions also often show the stack trace across multiple lines.
In monolithic server-based applications, you can write logs to a file on disk (a logfile) and then analyze
it with any tool. Since application execution is limited to a fixed server or VM, it generally isn’t too
complex to analyze the flow of events. However, in a distributed application where multiple services
are executed across many nodes in an orchestrator cluster, being able to correlate distributed events
is a challenge.
A microservice-based application should not try to store the output stream of events or logfiles by
itself, and not even try to manage the routing of the events to a central place. It should be
transparent, meaning that each process should just write its event stream to a standard output that
underneath will be collected by the execution environment infrastructure where it’s running. An
example of these event stream routers is Microsoft.Diagnostic.EventFlow, which collects event streams
from multiple sources and publishes it to output systems. These can include simple standard output
for a development environment or cloud systems like Azure Monitor and Azure Diagnostics. There are
also good third-party log analysis platforms and tools that can search, alert, report, and monitor logs,
even in real time, like Splunk.
64 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

Orchestrators managing health and diagnostics information
When you create a microservice-based application, you need to deal with complexity. Of course, a
single microservice is simple to deal with, but dozens or hundreds of types and thousands of
instances of microservices is a complex problem. It isn’t just about building your microservice
architecture—you also need high availability, addressability, resiliency, health, and diagnostics if you
intend to have a stable and cohesive system.
Figure 4-22. A Microservice Platform is fundamental for an application’s health management
The complex problems shown in Figure 4-22 are hard to solve by yourself. Development teams should
focus on solving business problems and building custom applications with microservice-based
approaches. They should not focus on solving complex infrastructure problems; if they did, the cost of
any microservice-based application would be huge. Therefore, there are microservice-oriented
platforms, referred to as orchestrators or microservice clusters, that try to solve the hard problems of
building and running a service and using infrastructure resources efficiently. This approach reduces
the complexities of building applications that use a microservices approach.
Different orchestrators might sound similar, but the diagnostics and health checks offered by each of
them differ in features and state of maturity, sometimes depending on the OS platform, as explained
in the next section.

Orchestrate microservices and multi-container
applications for high scalability and availability
Using orchestrators for production-ready applications is essential if your application is based on
microservices or simply split across multiple containers. As introduced previously, in a microservice-
based approach, each microservice owns its model and data so that it will be autonomous from a
development and deployment point of view. But even if you have a more traditional application that’s
composed of multiple services (like SOA), you’ll also have multiple containers or services comprising a
single business application that need to be deployed as a distributed system. These kinds of systems
are complex to scale out and manage; therefore, you absolutely need an orchestrator if you want to
have a production-ready and scalable multi-container application.
Figure 4-23 illustrates deployment into a cluster of an application composed of multiple microservices
(containers).
66 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications

Figure 4-23. A cluster of containers
You use one container for each service instance. Docker containers are “units of deployment” and a
container is an instance of a Docker. A host handles many containers. It looks like a logical approach.
But how are you handling load-balancing, routing, and orchestrating these composed applications?
The plain Docker Engine in single Docker hosts meets the needs of managing single image instances
on one host, but it falls short when it comes to managing multiple containers deployed on multiple
hosts for more complex distributed applications. In most cases, you need a management platform
that will automatically start containers, scale out containers with multiple instances per image,
suspend them or shut them down when needed, and ideally also control how they access resources
like the network and data storage.
To go beyond the management of individual containers or simple composed apps and move toward
larger enterprise applications with microservices, you must turn to orchestration and clustering
platforms.
From an architecture and development point of view, if you’re building large enterprise composed of
microservices-based applications, it’s important to understand the following platforms and products
that support advanced scenarios:
Clusters and orchestrators. When you need to scale out applications across many Docker hosts, as
when a large microservice-based application, it’s critical to be able to manage all those hosts as a
single cluster by abstracting the complexity of the underlying platform. That’s what the container
clusters and orchestrators provide. Kubernetes is an example of an orchestrator, and is available in
Azure through Azure Kubernetes Service.
Schedulers. Scheduling means to have the capability for an administrator to launch containers in a
cluster so they also provide a UI. A cluster scheduler has several responsibilities: to use the cluster’s
67 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


resources efficiently, to set the constraints provided by the user, to efficiently load-balance containers
across nodes or hosts, and to be robust against errors while providing high availability.
The concepts of a cluster and a scheduler are closely related, so the products provided by different
vendors often provide both sets of capabilities. The following list shows the most important platform
and software choices you have for clusters and schedulers. These orchestrators are generally offered
in public clouds like Azure.
Software platforms for container clustering, orchestration, and
scheduling
Platform Description
Kubernetes Kubernetes is an open-source
product that provides functionality
that ranges from cluster
infrastructure and container
scheduling to orchestrating
capabilities. It lets you automate
deployment, scaling, and
operations of application
containers across clusters of hosts.
Kubernetes provides a container-
centric infrastructure that groups
application containers into logical
units for easy management and
discovery.
Kubernetes is mature in Linux, less
mature in Windows.
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) AKS is a managed Kubernetes
container orchestration service in
Azure that simplifies Kubernetes
cluster’s management, deployment,
and operations.
Azure Container Apps Azure Container Apps is a managed
serverless container service for
building and deploying modern
apps at scale.
Using container-based orchestrators in Microsoft Azure
Several cloud vendors offer Docker containers support plus Docker clusters and orchestration support,
including Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2 Container Service, and Google Container Engine. Microsoft
Azure provides Docker cluster and orchestrator support through Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
68 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications




Using Azure Kubernetes Service
A Kubernetes cluster pools multiple Docker hosts and exposes them as a single virtual Docker host, so
you can deploy multiple containers into the cluster and scale-out with any number of container
instances. The cluster will handle all the complex management plumbing, like scalability, health, and
so forth.
AKS provides a way to simplify the creation, configuration, and management of a cluster of virtual
machines in Azure that are preconfigured to run containerized applications. Using an optimized
configuration of popular open-source scheduling and orchestration tools, AKS enables you to use
your existing skills or draw on a large and growing body of community expertise to deploy and
manage container-based applications on Microsoft Azure.
Azure Kubernetes Service optimizes the configuration of popular Docker clustering open-source tools
and technologies specifically for Azure. You get an open solution that offers portability for both your
containers and your application configuration. You select the size, the number of hosts, and the
orchestrator tools, and AKS handles everything else.
Figure 4-24. Kubernetes cluster’s simplified structure and topology
69 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


In figure 4-24, you can see the structure of a Kubernetes cluster where a master node (VM) controls
most of the coordination of the cluster and you can deploy containers to the rest of the nodes, which
are managed as a single pool from an application point of view and allows you to scale to thousands
or even tens of thousands of containers.
Development environment for Kubernetes
In the development environment, Docker announced in July 2018 that Kubernetes can also run in a
single development machine (Windows 10 or macOS) by installing Docker Desktop. You can later
deploy to the cloud (AKS) for further integration tests, as shown in figure 4-25.
Figure 4-25. Running Kubernetes in dev machine and the cloud
Getting started with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
To begin using AKS, you deploy an AKS cluster from the Azure portal or by using the CLI. For more
information on deploying a Kubernetes cluster in Azure, see Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service
(AKS) cluster.
There are no fees for any of the software installed by default as part of AKS. All default options are
implemented with open-source software. AKS is available for multiple virtual machines in Azure.
You’re charged only for the compute instances you choose, and the other underlying infrastructure
resources consumed, such as storage and networking. There are no incremental charges for AKS itself.
The default production deployment option for Kubernetes is to use Helm charts, which are introduced
in the next section.
70 CHAPTER 3 | Architecting container and microservice-based applications


Deploy with Helm charts into Kubernetes clusters
When deploying an application to a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the original kubectl.exe CLI tool
using deployment files based on the native format (.yaml files), as already mentioned in the previous
section. However, for more complex Kubernetes applications such as when deploying complex
microservice-based applications, it’s recommended to use Helm.
Helm Charts helps you define, version, install, share, upgrade, or rollback even the most complex
Kubernetes application.
Going further, Helm usage is also recommended because other Kubernetes environments in Azure,
such as Azure Dev Spaces are also based on Helm charts.
Helm is maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) - in collaboration with
Microsoft, Google, Bitnami, and the Helm contributor community.
For more implementation information on Helm charts and Kubernetes, see the Using Helm Charts to
deploy eShopOnContainers to AKS post.

CHAPTER
Development process for
Docker-based applications
Develop containerized .NET applications the way you like, either Integrated Development Environment
(IDE) focused with Visual Studio and Visual Studio tools for Docker or CLI/Editor focused with Docker CLI
and Visual Studio Code.
Development environment for Docker apps
Development tool choices: IDE or editor
Whether you prefer a full and powerful IDE or a lightweight and agile editor, Microsoft has tools that
you can use for developing Docker applications.
Visual Studio (for Windows). Docker-based .NET 7 application development with Visual Studio
requires Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0 or later. Visual Studio 2022 comes with tools for Docker
already built in. The tools for Docker let you develop, run, and validate your applications directly in the
target Docker environment. You can press F5 to run and debug your application (single container or
multiple containers) directly into a Docker host, or press CTRL + F5 to edit and refresh your
application without having to rebuild the container. This IDE is the most powerful development choice
for Docker-based apps.
Visual Studio for Mac. It’s an IDE, evolution of Xamarin Studio, running in macOS. This tool should
be the preferred choice for developers working in macOS machines who also want to use a powerful
IDE.
Visual Studio Code and Docker CLI. If you prefer a lightweight and cross-platform editor that
supports any development language, you can use Visual Studio Code and the Docker CLI. This IDE is a
cross-platform development approach for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Additionally, Visual Studio
Code supports extensions for Docker such as IntelliSense for Dockerfiles and shortcut tasks to run
Docker commands from the editor.
By installing Docker Desktop, you can use a single Docker CLI to build apps for both Windows and
Linux.

.NET languages and frameworks for Docker
containers
As mentioned in earlier sections of this guide, you can use .NET Framework, .NET 7, or the open-
source Mono project when developing Docker containerized .NET applications. You can develop in
C#, F#, or Visual Basic when targeting Linux or Windows Containers, depending on which .NET
framework is in use. For more details about.NET languages, see the blog post The .NET Language
Strategy.
Development workflow for Docker apps
The application development life cycle starts at your computer, as a developer, where you code the
application using your preferred language and test it locally. With this workflow, no matter which
language, framework, and platform you choose, you’re always developing and testing Docker
containers, but doing so locally.
Each container (an instance of a Docker image) includes the following components:
• An operating system selection, for example, a Linux distribution, Windows Nano Server, or
Windows Server Core.
• Files added during development, for example, source code and application binaries.
• Configuration information, such as environment settings and dependencies.
Workflow for developing Docker container-based applications
This section describes the inner-loop development workflow for Docker container-based applications.
The inner-loop workflow means it’s not considering the broader DevOps workflow, which can include
up to production deployment, and just focuses on the development work done on the developer’s
computer. The initial steps to set up the environment aren’t included, since those steps are done only
once.
73 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications

An application is composed of your own services plus additional libraries (dependencies). The
following are the basic steps you usually take when building a Docker application, as illustrated in
Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1. Step-by-step workflow for developing Docker containerized apps
In this section, this whole process is detailed and every major step is explained by focusing on a Visual
Studio environment.
When you’re using an editor/CLI development approach (for example, Visual Studio Code plus Docker
CLI on macOS or Windows), you need to know every step, generally in more detail than if you’re using
Visual Studio. For more information about working in a CLI environment, see the e-book
Containerized Docker Application lifecycle with Microsoft Platforms and Tools.
When you’re using Visual Studio 2022, many of those steps are handled for you, which dramatically
improves your productivity. This is especially true when you’re using Visual Studio 2022 and targeting
multi-container applications. For instance, with just one mouse click, Visual Studio adds the Dockerfile
and docker-compose.yml file to your projects with the configuration for your application. When you
run the application in Visual Studio, it builds the Docker image and runs the multi-container
application directly in Docker; it even allows you to debug several containers at once. These features
will boost your development speed.
However, just because Visual Studio makes those steps automatic doesn’t mean that you don’t need
to know what’s going on underneath with Docker. Therefore, the following guidance details every
step.
74 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications


Step 1. Start coding and create your initial application or service
baseline
Developing a Docker application is similar to the way you develop an application without Docker. The
difference is that while developing for Docker, you’re deploying and testing your application or
services running within Docker containers in your local environment (either a Linux VM setup by
Docker or directly Windows if using Windows Containers).
Set up your local environment with Visual Studio
To begin, make sure you have Docker Desktop for Windows for Windows installed, as explained in the
following instructions:
Get started with Docker Desktop for Windows
In addition, you need Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0, with the .ASP.NET and web development
workload installed, as shown in Figure 5-2.
Figure 5-2. Selecting the ASP.NET and web development workload during Visual Studio 2022 setup
You can start coding your application in plain .NET (usually in .NET Core or later if you’re planning to
use containers) even before enabling Docker in your application and deploying and testing in Docker.
However, it is recommended that you start working on Docker as soon as possible, because that will
be the real environment and any issues can be discovered as soon as possible. This is encouraged
75 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications

because Visual Studio makes it so easy to work with Docker that it almost feels transparent—the best
example when debugging multi-container applications from Visual Studio.

https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/
• Visual Studio 2022
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
Step 2. Create a Dockerfile related to an existing .NET base image
You need a Dockerfile for each custom image you want to build; you also need a Dockerfile for each
container to be deployed, whether you deploy automatically from Visual Studio or manually using the
Docker CLI (docker run and docker-compose commands). If your application contains a single custom
service, you need a single Dockerfile. If your application contains multiple services (as in a
microservices architecture), you need one Dockerfile for each service.
The Dockerfile is placed in the root folder of your application or service. It contains the commands
that tell Docker how to set up and run your application or service in a container. You can manually
create a Dockerfile in code and add it to your project along with your .NET dependencies.
With Visual Studio and its tools for Docker, this task requires only a few mouse clicks. When you
create a new project in Visual Studio 2022, there’s an option named Enable Docker Support, as
shown in Figure 5-3.
76 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications


Figure 5-3. Enabling Docker Support when creating a new ASP.NET Core project in Visual Studio 2022
You can also enable Docker support on an existing ASP.NET Core web app project by right-clicking
the project in Solution Explorer and selecting Add > Docker Support…, as shown in Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-4. Enabling Docker support in an existing Visual Studio 2022 project
77 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications



This action adds a Dockerfile to the project with the required configuration, and is only available on
ASP.NET Core projects.
In a similar fashion, Visual Studio can also add a docker-compose.yml file for the whole solution with
the option Add > Container Orchestrator Support…. In step 4, we’ll explore this option in greater
detail.
Using an existing official .NET Docker image
You usually build a custom image for your container on top of a base image you get from an official
repository like the Docker Hub registry. That is precisely what happens under the covers when you
enable Docker support in Visual Studio. Your Dockerfile will use an existing dotnet/core/aspnet image.
Earlier we explained which Docker images and repos you can use, depending on the framework and
OS you have chosen. For instance, if you want to use ASP.NET Core (Linux or Windows), the image to
use is mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0. Therefore, you just need to specify what base Docker
image you will use for your container. You do that by adding FROM
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 to your Dockerfile. This will be automatically performed by
Visual Studio, but if you were to update the version, you update this value.
Using an official .NET image repository from Docker Hub with a version number ensures that the same
language features are available on all machines (including development, testing, and production).
The following example shows a sample Dockerfile for an ASP.NET Core container.
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0
ARG source
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
COPY ${source:-obj/Docker/publish} .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", " MySingleContainerWebApp.dll "]
In this case, the image is based on version 7.0 of the official ASP.NET Core Docker image (multi-arch
for Linux and Windows). This is the setting FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0. (For more
information about this base image, see the ASP.NET Core Docker Image page.) In the Dockerfile, you
also need to instruct Docker to listen on the TCP port you will use at runtime (in this case, port 80, as
configured with the EXPOSE setting).
You can specify additional configuration settings in the Dockerfile, depending on the language and
framework you’re using. For instance, the ENTRYPOINT line with ["dotnet",
"MySingleContainerWebApp.dll"] tells Docker to run a .NET application. If you’re using the SDK and
the .NET CLI (dotnet CLI) to build and run the .NET application, this setting would be different. The
bottom line is that the ENTRYPOINT line and other settings will be different depending on the
language and platform you choose for your application.

update/
Using multi-arch image repositories
A single repo can contain platform variants, such as a Linux image and a Windows image. This feature
allows vendors like Microsoft (base image creators) to create a single repo to cover multiple platforms
(that is Linux and Windows). For example, the .NET repository available in the Docker Hub registry
provides support for Linux and Windows Nano Server by using the same repo name.
If you specify a tag, targeting a platform that is explicit like in the following cases:
• mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0-bullseye-slim
Targets: .NET 7 runtime-only on Linux
• mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0-nanoserver-ltsc2022
Targets: .NET 7 runtime-only on Windows Nano Server
But, if you specify the same image name, even with the same tag, the multi-arch images (like the
aspnet image) will use the Linux or Windows version depending on the Docker host OS you’re
deploying, as shown in the following example:
• mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0
Multi-arch: .NET 7 runtime-only on Linux or Windows Nano Server depending on the Docker
host OS
This way, when you pull an image from a Windows host, it will pull the Windows variant, and pulling
the same image name from a Linux host will pull the Linux variant.
Multi-stage builds in Dockerfile
The Dockerfile is similar to a batch script. Similar to what you would do if you had to set up the
machine from the command line.
It starts with a base image that sets up the initial context, it’s like the startup filesystem, that sits on
top of the host OS. It’s not an OS, but you can think of it like “the” OS inside the container.
The execution of every command line creates a new layer on the filesystem with the changes from the
previous one, so that, when combined, produce the resulting filesystem.
Since every new layer “rests” on top of the previous one and the resulting image size increases with
every command, images can get very large if they have to include, for example, the SDK needed to
build and publish an application.
This is where multi-stage builds get into the plot (from Docker 17.05 and higher) to do their magic.
79 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications

The core idea is that you can separate the Dockerfile execution process in stages, where a stage is an
initial image followed by one or more commands, and the last stage determines the final image size.
In short, multi-stage builds allow splitting the creation in different “phases” and then assemble the
final image taking only the relevant directories from the intermediate stages. The general strategy to
use this feature is:
1. Use a base SDK image (doesn’t matter how large), with everything needed to build and
publish the application to a folder and then
2. Use a base, small, runtime-only image and copy the publishing folder from the previous stage
to produce a small final image.
Probably the best way to understand multi-stage is going through a Dockerfile in detail, line by line,
so let’s begin with the initial Dockerfile created by Visual Studio when adding Docker support to a
project and will get into some optimizations later.
The initial Dockerfile might look something like this:
1 FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS base
2 WORKDIR /app
3 EXPOSE 80
4
5 FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build
6 WORKDIR /src
7 COPY src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.API/Catalog.API.csproj …
8 COPY src/BuildingBlocks/HealthChecks/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.HealthChecks …
9 COPY src/BuildingBlocks/HealthChecks/src/Microsoft.Extensions.HealthChecks …
10 COPY src/BuildingBlocks/EventBus/IntegrationEventLogEF/ …
11 COPY src/BuildingBlocks/EventBus/EventBus/EventBus.csproj …
12 COPY src/BuildingBlocks/EventBus/EventBusRabbitMQ/EventBusRabbitMQ.csproj …
13 COPY src/BuildingBlocks/EventBus/EventBusServiceBus/EventBusServiceBus.csproj …
14 COPY src/BuildingBlocks/WebHostCustomization/WebHost.Customization …
15 COPY src/BuildingBlocks/HealthChecks/src/Microsoft.Extensions …
16 COPY src/BuildingBlocks/HealthChecks/src/Microsoft.Extensions …
17 RUN dotnet restore src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.API/Catalog.API.csproj
18 COPY . .
19 WORKDIR /src/src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.API
20 RUN dotnet build Catalog.API.csproj -c Release -o /app
21
22 FROM build AS publish
23 RUN dotnet publish Catalog.API.csproj -c Release -o /app
24
25 FROM base AS final
26 WORKDIR /app
27 COPY --from=publish /app .
28 ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Catalog.API.dll"]
And these are the details, line by line:
• Line #1: Begin a stage with a “small” runtime-only base image, call it base for reference.
• Line #2: Create the /app directory in the image.
• Line #3: Expose port 80.
80 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications

• Line #5: Begin a new stage with the “large” image for building/publishing. Call it build for
reference.
• Line #6: Create directory /src in the image.
• Line #7: Up to line 16, copy referenced .csproj project files to be able to restore packages
later.
• Line #17: Restore packages for the Catalog.API project and the referenced projects.
• Line #18: Copy all directory tree for the solution (except the files/directories included in the
.dockerignore file) to the /src directory in the image.
• Line #19: Change the current folder to the Catalog.API project.
• Line #20: Build the project (and other project dependencies) and output to the /app
directory in the image.
• Line #22: Begin a new stage continuing from the build. Call it publish for reference.
• Line #23: Publish the project (and dependencies) and output to the /app directory in the
image.
• Line #25: Begin a new stage continuing from base and call it final.
• Line #26: Change the current directory to /app.
• Line #27: Copy the /app directory from stage publish to the current directory.
• Line #28: Define the command to run when the container is started.
Now let’s explore some optimizations to improve the whole process performance that, in the case of
eShopOnContainers, means about 22 minutes or more to build the complete solution in Linux
containers.
You’ll take advantage of Docker’s layer cache feature, which is quite simple: if the base image and the
commands are the same as some previously executed, it can just use the resulting layer without the
need to execute the commands, thus saving some time.
So, let’s focus on the build stage, lines 5-6 are mostly the same, but lines 7-17 are different for every
service from eShopOnContainers, so they have to execute every single time, however if you changed
lines 7-16 to:
COPY . .
Then it would be just the same for every service, it would copy the whole solution and would create a
larger layer but:
1. The copy process would only be executed the first time (and when rebuilding if a file is
changed) and would use the cache for all other services and
2. Since the larger image occurs in an intermediate stage, it doesn’t affect the final image size.
81 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications

The next significant optimization involves the restore command executed in line 17, which is also
different for every service of eShopOnContainers. If you change that line to just:
RUN dotnet restore
It would restore the packages for the whole solution, but then again, it would do it just once, instead
of the 15 times with the current strategy.
However, dotnet restore only runs if there’s a single project or solution file in the folder, so achieving
this is a bit more complicated and the way to solve it, without getting into too many details, is this:
1. Add the following lines to .dockerignore:
– *.sln, to ignore all solution files in the main folder tree
– !eShopOnContainers-ServicesAndWebApps.sln, to include only this solution file.
2. Include the /ignoreprojectextensions:.dcproj argument to dotnet restore, so it also ignores the
docker-compose project and only restores the packages for the eShopOnContainers-
ServicesAndWebApps solution.
For the final optimization, it just happens that line 20 is redundant, as line 23 also builds the
application and comes, in essence, right after line 20, so there goes another time-consuming
command.
The resulting file is then:
1 FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS base
2 WORKDIR /app
3 EXPOSE 80
4
5 FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS publish
6 WORKDIR /src
7 COPY . .
8 RUN dotnet restore /ignoreprojectextensions:.dcproj
9 WORKDIR /src/src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.API
10 RUN dotnet publish Catalog.API.csproj -c Release -o /app
11
12 FROM base AS final
13 WORKDIR /app
14 COPY --from=publish /app .
15 ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Catalog.API.dll"]
Creating your base image from scratch
You can create your own Docker base image from scratch. This scenario is not recommended for
someone who is starting with Docker, but if you want to set the specific bits of your own base image,
you can do so.

• Create a base image. Official Docker documentation.
https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/baseimages/
Step 3. Create your custom Docker images and embed your
application or service in them
For each service in your application, you need to create a related image. If your application is made up
of a single service or web application, you just need a single image.
Note that the Docker images are built automatically for you in Visual Studio. The following steps are
only needed for the editor/CLI workflow and explained for clarity about what happens underneath.
You, as a developer, need to develop and test locally until you push a completed feature or change to
your source control system (for example, to GitHub). This means that you need to create the Docker
images and deploy containers to a local Docker host (Windows or Linux VM) and run, test, and debug
against those local containers.
To create a custom image in your local environment by using Docker CLI and your Dockerfile, you can
use the docker build command, as in Figure 5-5.
Figure 5-5. Creating a custom Docker image
Optionally, instead of directly running docker build from the project folder, you can first generate a
deployable folder with the required .NET libraries and binaries by running dotnet publish, and then
use the docker build command.
This will create a Docker image with the name cesardl/netcore-webapi-microservice-docker:first. In
this case, :first is a tag that represents a specific version. You can repeat this step for each custom
image you need to create for your composed Docker application.
When an application is made of multiple containers (that is, it is a multi-container application), you
can also use the docker-compose up --build command to build all the related images with a single
command by using the metadata exposed in the related docker-compose.yml files.
You can find the existing images in your local repository by using the docker images command, as
shown in Figure 5-6.
83 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications



Figure 5-6. Viewing existing images using the docker images command
Creating Docker images with Visual Studio
When you use Visual Studio to create a project with Docker support, you don’t explicitly create an
image. Instead, the image is created for you when you press F5 (or Ctrl+F5) to run the dockerized
application or service. This step is automatic in Visual Studio and you won’t see it happen, but it’s
important that you know what’s going on underneath.
Step 4. Define your services in docker-compose.yml when building a
multi-container Docker application
The docker-compose.yml file lets you define a set of related services to be deployed as a composed
application with deployment commands. It also configures its dependency relations and runtime
configuration.
To use a docker-compose.yml file, you need to create the file in your main or root solution folder, with
content similar to that in the following example:
version: '3.4'
services:
webmvc:
image: eshop/web
environment:
- CatalogUrl=http://catalog-api
- OrderingUrl=http://ordering-api
ports:
- "80:80"
depends_on:
- catalog-api
- ordering-api
catalog-api:
image: eshop/catalog-api
environment:
- ConnectionString=Server=sqldata;Port=1433;Database=CatalogDB;…
ports:
- "81:80"
depends_on:
- sqldata
ordering-api:
image: eshop/ordering-api
84 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications



environment:
- ConnectionString=Server=sqldata;Database=OrderingDb;…
ports:
- "82:80"
extra_hosts:
- "CESARDLBOOKVHD:10.0.75.1"
depends_on:
- sqldata
sqldata:
image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:latest
environment:
- SA_PASSWORD=Pass@word
- ACCEPT_EULA=Y
ports:
- "5433:1433"
This docker-compose.yml file is a simplified and merged version. It contains static configuration data
for each container (like the name of the custom image), which is always required, and configuration
information that might depend on the deployment environment, like the connection string. In later
sections, you will learn how to split the docker-compose.yml configuration into multiple docker-
compose files and override values depending on the environment and execution type (debug or
release).
The docker-compose.yml file example defines four services: the webmvc service (a web application),
two microservices (ordering-api and basket-api), and one data source container, sqldata, based on
SQL Server for Linux running as a container. Each service will be deployed as a container, so a Docker
image is required for each.
The docker-compose.yml file specifies not only what containers are being used, but how they are
individually configured. For instance, the webmvc container definition in the .yml file:
• Uses a pre-built eshop/web:latest image. However, you could also configure the image to be
built as part of the docker-compose execution with an additional configuration based on a
build: section in the docker-compose file.
• Initializes two environment variables (CatalogUrl and OrderingUrl).
• Forwards the exposed port 80 on the container to the external port 80 on the host machine.
• Links the web app to the catalog and ordering service with the depends_on setting. This
causes the service to wait until those services are started.
We will revisit the docker-compose.yml file in a later section when we cover how to implement
microservices and multi-container apps.
Working with docker-compose.yml in Visual Studio 2022
Besides adding a Dockerfile to a project, as we mentioned before, Visual Studio 2017 (from version
15.8 on) can add orchestrator support for Docker Compose to a solution.
When you add container orchestrator support, as shown in Figure 5-7, for the first time, Visual Studio
creates the Dockerfile for the project and creates a new (service section) project in your solution with
85 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications


---

several global docker-compose*.yml files, and then adds the project to those files. You can then open
the docker-compose.yml files and update them with additional features.
Repeat this operation for every project you want to include in the docker-compose.yml file.
At the time of this writing, Visual Studio supports Docker Compose orchestrators.
Figure 5-7. Adding Docker support in Visual Studio 2022 by right-clicking an ASP.NET Core project
After you add orchestrator support to your solution in Visual Studio, you will also see a new node (in
the docker-compose.dcproj project file) in Solution Explorer that contains the added docker-
compose.yml files, as shown in Figure 5-8.
Figure 5-8. The docker-compose tree node added in Visual Studio 2022 Solution Explorer
You could deploy a multi-container application with a single docker-compose.yml file by using the
docker-compose up command. However, Visual Studio adds a group of them so you can override
values depending on the environment (development or production) and execution type (release or
debug). This capability will be explained in later sections.
86 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications



Step 5. Build and run your Docker application
If your application only has a single container, you can run it by deploying it to your Docker host (VM
or physical server). However, if your application contains multiple services, you can deploy it as a
composed application, either using a single CLI command (docker-compose up), or with Visual Studio,
which will use that command under the covers. Let’s look at the different options.
Option A: Running a single-container application
Using Docker CLI
You can run a Docker container using the docker run command, as shown in Figure 5-9:
docker run -t -d -p 80:5000 cesardl/netcore-webapi-microservice-docker:first
The above command will create a new container instance from the specified image, every time it’s run.
You can use the --name parameter to give a name to the container and then use docker start {name}
(or use the container ID or automatic name) to run an existing container instance.
Figure 5-9. Running a Docker container using the docker run command
In this case, the command binds the internal port 5000 of the container to port 80 of the host
machine. This means that the host is listening on port 80 and forwarding to port 5000 on the
container.
The hash shown is the container ID and it’s also assigned a random readable name if the --name
option is not used.
Using Visual Studio
If you haven’t added container orchestrator support, you can also run a single container app in Visual
Studio by pressing Ctrl+F5 and you can also use F5 to debug the application within the container. The
container runs locally using docker run.
Option B: Running a multi-container application
In most enterprise scenarios, a Docker application will be composed of multiple services, which means
you need to run a multi-container application, as shown in Figure 5-10.
87 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications



Figure 5-10. VM with Docker containers deployed
Using Docker CLI
To run a multi-container application with the Docker CLI, you use the docker-compose up command.
This command uses the docker-compose.yml file that you have at the solution level to deploy a
multi-container application. Figure 5-11 shows the results when running the command from your
main solution directory, which contains the docker-compose.yml file.
Figure 5-11. Example results when running the docker-compose up command
After the docker-compose up command runs, the application and its related containers are deployed
into your Docker host, as depicted in Figure 5-10.
Using Visual Studio
Running a multi-container application using Visual Studio 2019 can’t get any simpler. You just press
Ctrl+F5 to run or F5 to debug, as usual, setting up the docker-compose project as the startup project.
Visual Studio handles all needed setup, so you can create breakpoints as usual and debug what finally
become independent processes running in “remote servers”, with the debugger already attached, just
like that.
As mentioned before, each time you add Docker solution support to a project within a solution, that
project is configured in the global (solution-level) docker-compose.yml file, which lets you run or
debug the whole solution at once. Visual Studio will start one container for each project that has
Docker solution support enabled, and perform all the internal steps for you (dotnet publish, docker
build, etc.).
If you want to take a peek at all the drudgery, take a look at the file:
{root solution folder}\obj\Docker\docker-compose.vs.debug.g.yml
88 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications



The important point here is that, as shown in Figure 5-12, in Visual Studio 2019 there is an additional
Docker command for the F5 key action. This option lets you run or debug a multi-container
application by running all the containers that are defined in the docker-compose.yml files at the
solution level. The ability to debug multiple-container solutions means that you can set several
breakpoints, each breakpoint in a different project (container), and while debugging from Visual
Studio you will stop at breakpoints defined in different projects and running on different containers.
Figure 5-12. Running multi-container apps in Visual Studio 2022

A note about testing and deploying with orchestrators
The docker-compose up and docker run commands (or running and debugging the containers in
Visual Studio) are adequate for testing containers in your development environment. But you should
not use this approach for production deployments, where you should target orchestrators like
Kubernetes or Service Fabric. If you’re using Kubernetes, you have to use pods to organize containers
and services to network them. You also use deployments to organize pod creation and modification.
Step 6. Test your Docker application using your local Docker host
This step will vary depending on what your application is doing. In a simple .NET Web application that
is deployed as a single container or service, you can access the service by opening a browser on the
Docker host and navigating to that site, as shown in Figure 5-13. (If the configuration in the Dockerfile
maps the container to a port on the host that is anything other than 80, include the host port in the
URL.)
Figure 5-13. Example of testing your Docker application locally using localhost
89 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications




If localhost is not pointing to the Docker host IP (by default, when using Docker CE, it should), to
navigate to your service, use the IP address of your machine’s network card.
This URL in the browser uses port 80 for the particular container example being discussed. However,
internally the requests are being redirected to port 5000, because that was how it was deployed with
the docker run command, as explained in a previous step.
You can also test the application using curl from the terminal, as shown in Figure 5-14. In a Docker
installation on Windows, the default Docker Host IP is always 10.0.75.1 in addition to your machine’s
actual IP address.
Figure 5-14. Example of testing your Docker application locally using curl
Testing and debugging containers with Visual Studio 2022
When running and debugging the containers with Visual Studio 2022, you can debug the .NET
application in much the same way as you would when running without containers.
Testing and debugging without Visual Studio
If you’re developing using the editor/CLI approach, debugging containers is more difficult and you’ll
probably want to debug by generating traces.

https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/containers/edit-and-refresh
Simplified workflow when developing containers with Visual Studio
Effectively, the workflow when using Visual Studio is a lot simpler than if you use the editor/CLI
approach. Most of the steps required by Docker related to the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
files are hidden or simplified by Visual Studio, as shown in Figure 5-15.
90 CHAPTER 4 | Development process for Docker-based applications


Figure 5-15. Simplified workflow when developing with Visual Studio
In addition, you need to perform step 2 (adding Docker support to your projects) just once. Therefore,
the workflow is similar to your usual development tasks when using .NET for any other development.
You need to know what is going on under the covers (the image build process, what base images
you’re using, deployment of containers, etc.) and sometimes you will also need to edit the Dockerfile
or docker-compose.yml file to customize behaviors. But most of the work is greatly simplified by using
Visual Studio, making you a lot more productive.
Using PowerShell commands in a Dockerfile to set up Windows
Containers
Windows Containers allow you to convert your existing Windows applications into Docker images and
deploy them with the same tools as the rest of the Docker ecosystem. To use Windows Containers,
you run PowerShell commands in the Dockerfile, as shown in the following example:
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore
LABEL Description="IIS" Vendor="Microsoft" Version="10"
RUN powershell -Command Add-WindowsFeature Web-Server
CMD [ "ping", "localhost", "-t" ]
In this case, we are using a Windows Server Core base image (the FROM setting) and installing IIS with
a PowerShell command (the RUN setting). In a similar way, you could also use PowerShell commands
to set up additional components like ASP.NET 4.x, .NET Framework 4.6, or any other Windows
software. For example, the following command in a Dockerfile sets up ASP.NET 4.5:
RUN powershell add-windowsfeature web-asp-net45

CHAPTER
Designing and Developing
Multi-Container and
Microservice-Based .NET
Applications
Developing containerized microservice applications means you are building multi-container
applications. However, a multi-container application could also be simpler—for example, a three-tier
application—and might not be built using a microservice architecture.
Earlier we raised the question “Is Docker necessary when building a microservice architecture?” The
answer is a clear no. Docker is an enabler and can provide significant benefits, but containers and
Docker are not a hard requirement for microservices. As an example, you could create a
microservices-based application with or without Docker when using Azure Service Fabric, which
supports microservices running as simple processes or as Docker containers.
However, if you know how to design and develop a microservices-based application that is also based
on Docker containers, you will be able to design and develop any other, simpler application model.
For example, you might design a three-tier application that also requires a multi-container approach.
Because of that, and because microservice architectures are an important trend within the container
world, this section focuses on a microservice architecture implementation using Docker containers.
Design a microservice-oriented application
This section focuses on developing a hypothetical server-side enterprise application.
Application specifications
The hypothetical application handles requests by executing business logic, accessing databases, and
then returning HTML, JSON, or XML responses. We will say that the application must support various
clients, including desktop browsers running Single Page Applications (SPAs), traditional web apps,
mobile web apps, and native mobile apps. The application might also expose an API for third parties
93 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

to consume. It should also be able to integrate its microservices or external applications
asynchronously, so that approach will help resiliency of the microservices in the case of partial failures.
The application will consist of these types of components:
• Presentation components. These components are responsible for handling the UI and
consuming remote services.
• Domain or business logic. This component is the application’s domain logic.
• Database access logic. This component consists of data access components responsible for
accessing databases (SQL or NoSQL).
• Application integration logic. This component includes a messaging channel, based on
message brokers.
The application will require high scalability, while allowing its vertical subsystems to scale out
autonomously, because certain subsystems will require more scalability than others.
The application must be able to be deployed in multiple infrastructure environments (multiple public
clouds and on-premises) and ideally should be cross-platform, able to move from Linux to Windows
(or vice versa) easily.
Development team context
We also assume the following about the development process for the application:
• You have multiple dev teams focusing on different business areas of the application.
• New team members must become productive quickly, and the application must be easy to
understand and modify.
• The application will have a long-term evolution and ever-changing business rules.
• You need good long-term maintainability, which means having agility when implementing
new changes in the future while being able to update multiple subsystems with minimum
impact on the other subsystems.
• You want to practice continuous integration and continuous deployment of the application.
• You want to take advantage of emerging technologies (frameworks, programming languages,
etc.) while evolving the application. You do not want to make full migrations of the
application when moving to new technologies, because that would result in high costs and
impact the predictability and stability of the application.
Choosing an architecture
What should the application deployment architecture be? The specifications for the application, along
with the development context, strongly suggest that you should architect the application by
decomposing it into autonomous subsystems in the form of collaborating microservices and
containers, where a microservice is a container.
94 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

In this approach, each service (container) implements a set of cohesive and narrowly related functions.
For example, an application might consist of services such as the catalog service, ordering service,
basket service, user profile service, etc.
Microservices communicate using protocols such as HTTP (REST), but also asynchronously (for
example, using AMQP) whenever possible, especially when propagating updates with integration
events.
Microservices are developed and deployed as containers independently of one another. This approach
means that a development team can be developing and deploying a certain microservice without
impacting other subsystems.
Each microservice has its own database, allowing it to be fully decoupled from other microservices.
When necessary, consistency between databases from different microservices is achieved using
application-level integration events (through a logical event bus), as handled in Command and Query
Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). Because of that, the business constraints must embrace eventual
consistency between the multiple microservices and related databases.
eShopOnContainers: A reference application for .NET and microservices deployed
using containers
So that you can focus on the architecture and technologies instead of thinking about a hypothetical
business domain that you might not know, we have selected a well-known business domain—namely,
a simplified e-commerce (e-shop) application that presents a catalog of products, takes orders from
customers, verifies inventory, and performs other business functions. This container-based application
source code is available in the eShopOnContainers GitHub repo.
The application consists of multiple subsystems, including several store UI front ends (a Web
application and a native mobile app), along with the back-end microservices and containers for all the
required server-side operations with several API Gateways as consolidated entry points to the internal
microservices. Figure 6-1 shows the architecture of the reference application.
95 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


---

Figure 6-1. The eShopOnContainers reference application architecture for development environment
The above diagram shows that Mobile and SPA clients communicate to single API gateway endpoints,
that then communicate to microservices. Traditional web clients communicate to MVC microservice,
that communicates to microservices through the API gateway.
Hosting environment. In Figure 6-1, you see several containers deployed within a single Docker host.
That would be the case when deploying to a single Docker host with the docker-compose up
command. However, if you are using an orchestrator or container cluster, each container could be
running in a different host (node), and any node could be running any number of containers, as we
explained earlier in the architecture section.
Communication architecture. The eShopOnContainers application uses two communication types,
depending on the kind of the functional action (queries versus updates and transactions):
• Http client-to-microservice communication through API Gateways. This approach is used for
queries and when accepting update or transactional commands from the client apps. The
approach using API Gateways is explained in detail in later sections.
• Asynchronous event-based communication. This communication occurs through an event bus
to propagate updates across microservices or to integrate with external applications. The
event bus can be implemented with any messaging-broker infrastructure technology like
RabbitMQ, or using higher-level (abstraction-level) service buses like Azure Service Bus,
NServiceBus, MassTransit, or Brighter.
The application is deployed as a set of microservices in the form of containers. Client apps can
communicate with those microservices running as containers through the public URLs published by
the API Gateways.
96 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


Data sovereignty per microservice
In the sample application, each microservice owns its own database or data source, although all SQL
Server databases are deployed as a single container. This design decision was made only to make it
easy for a developer to get the code from GitHub, clone it, and open it in Visual Studio or Visual
Studio Code. Or alternatively, it makes it easy to compile the custom Docker images using the .NET
CLI and the Docker CLI, and then deploy and run them in a Docker development environment. Either
way, using containers for data sources lets developers build and deploy in a matter of minutes without
having to provision an external database or any other data source with hard dependencies on
infrastructure (cloud or on-premises).
In a real production environment, for high availability and for scalability, the databases should be
based on database servers in the cloud or on-premises, but not in containers.
Therefore, the units of deployment for microservices (and even for databases in this application) are
Docker containers, and the reference application is a multi-container application that embraces
microservices principles.

https://aka.ms/eShopOnContainers/
Benefits of a microservice-based solution
A microservice-based solution like this has many benefits:
Each microservice is relatively small—easy to manage and evolve. Specifically:
• It is easy for a developer to understand and get started quickly with good productivity.
• Containers start fast, which makes developers more productive.
• An IDE like Visual Studio can load smaller projects fast, making developers productive.
• Each microservice can be designed, developed, and deployed independently of other
microservices, which provide agility because it is easier to deploy new versions of
microservices frequently.
It is possible to scale out individual areas of the application. For instance, the catalog service or
the basket service might need to be scaled out, but not the ordering process. A microservices
infrastructure will be much more efficient with regard to the resources used when scaling out than a
monolithic architecture would be.
You can divide the development work between multiple teams. Each service can be owned by a
single development team. Each team can manage, develop, deploy, and scale their service
independently of the rest of the teams.
Issues are more isolated. If there is an issue in one service, only that service is initially impacted
(except when the wrong design is used, with direct dependencies between microservices), and other
services can continue to handle requests. In contrast, one malfunctioning component in a monolithic
97 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

deployment architecture can bring down the entire system, especially when it involves resources, such
as a memory leak. Additionally, when an issue in a microservice is resolved, you can deploy just the
affected microservice without impacting the rest of the application.
You can use the latest technologies. Because you can start developing services independently and
run them side by side (thanks to containers and .NET), you can start using the latest technologies and
frameworks expediently instead of being stuck on an older stack or framework for the whole
application.
Downsides of a microservice-based solution
A microservice-based solution like this also has some drawbacks:
Distributed application. Distributing the application adds complexity for developers when they are
designing and building the services. For example, developers must implement inter-service
communication using protocols like HTTP or AMQP, which adds complexity for testing and exception
handling. It also adds latency to the system.
Deployment complexity. An application that has dozens of microservices types and needs high
scalability (it needs to be able to create many instances per service and balance those services across
many hosts) means a high degree of deployment complexity for IT operations and management. If
you are not using a microservice-oriented infrastructure (like an orchestrator and scheduler), that
additional complexity can require far more development efforts than the business application itself.
Atomic transactions. Atomic transactions between multiple microservices usually are not possible.
The business requirements have to embrace eventual consistency between multiple microservices.
Increased global resource needs (total memory, drives, and network resources for all the servers or
hosts). In many cases, when you replace a monolithic application with a microservices approach, the
amount of initial global resources needed by the new microservice-based application will be larger
than the infrastructure needs of the original monolithic application. This approach is because the
higher degree of granularity and distributed services requires more global resources. However, given
the low cost of resources in general and the benefit of being able to scale out certain areas of the
application compared to long-term costs when evolving monolithic applications, the increased use of
resources is usually a good tradeoff for large, long-term applications.
Issues with direct client-to-microservice communication. When the application is large, with
dozens of microservices, there are challenges and limitations if the application requires direct client-
to-microservice communications. One problem is a potential mismatch between the needs of the
client and the APIs exposed by each of the microservices. In certain cases, the client application might
need to make many separate requests to compose the UI, which can be inefficient over the Internet
and would be impractical over a mobile network. Therefore, requests from the client application to the
back-end system should be minimized.
Another problem with direct client-to-microservice communications is that some microservices might
be using protocols that are not Web-friendly. One service might use a binary protocol, while another
service might use AMQP messaging. Those protocols are not firewall-friendly and are best used
internally. Usually, an application should use protocols such as HTTP and WebSockets for
communication outside of the firewall.
98 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Yet another drawback with this direct client-to-service approach is that it makes it difficult to refactor
the contracts for those microservices. Over time developers might want to change how the system is
partitioned into services. For example, they might merge two services or split a service into two or
more services. However, if clients communicate directly with the services, performing this kind of
refactoring can break compatibility with client apps.
As mentioned in the architecture section, when designing and building a complex application based
on microservices, you might consider the use of multiple fine-grained API Gateways instead of the
simpler direct client-to-microservice communication approach.
Partitioning the microservices. Finally, no matter, which approach you take for your microservice
architecture, another challenge is deciding how to partition an end-to-end application into multiple
microservices. As noted in the architecture section of the guide, there are several techniques and
approaches you can take. Basically, you need to identify areas of the application that are decoupled
from the other areas and that have a low number of hard dependencies. In many cases, this approach
is aligned to partitioning services by use case. For example, in our e-shop application, we have an
ordering service that is responsible for all the business logic related to the order process. We also
have the catalog service and the basket service that implement other capabilities. Ideally, each service
should have only a small set of responsibilities. This approach is similar to the single responsibility
principle (SRP) applied to classes, which states that a class should only have one reason to change. But
in this case, it is about microservices, so the scope will be larger than a single class. Most of all, a
microservice has to be autonomous, end to end, including responsibility for its own data sources.
External versus internal architecture and design patterns
The external architecture is the microservice architecture composed by multiple services, following the
principles described in the architecture section of this guide. However, depending on the nature of
each microservice, and independently of high-level microservice architecture you choose, it is
common and sometimes advisable to have different internal architectures, each based on different
patterns, for different microservices. The microservices can even use different technologies and
programming languages. Figure 6-2 illustrates this diversity.
99 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Figure 6-2. External versus internal architecture and design
For instance, in our eShopOnContainers sample, the catalog, basket, and user profile microservices are
simple (basically, CRUD subsystems). Therefore, their internal architecture and design is
straightforward. However, you might have other microservices, such as the ordering microservice,
which is more complex and represents ever-changing business rules with a high degree of domain
complexity. In cases like these, you might want to implement more advanced patterns within a
particular microservice, like the ones defined with domain-driven design (DDD) approaches, as we are
doing in the eShopOnContainers ordering microservice. (We will review these DDD patterns in the
section later that explains the implementation of the eShopOnContainers ordering microservice.)
Another reason for a different technology per microservice might be the nature of each microservice.
For example, it might be better to use a functional programming language like F#, or even a language
like R if you are targeting AI and machine learning domains, instead of a more object-oriented
programming language like C#.
The bottom line is that each microservice can have a different internal architecture based on different
design patterns. Not all microservices should be implemented using advanced DDD patterns, because
that would be over-engineering them. Similarly, complex microservices with ever-changing business
logic should not be implemented as CRUD components, or you can end up with low-quality code.
The new world: multiple architectural patterns and polyglot
microservices
There are many architectural patterns used by software architects and developers. The following are a
few (mixing architecture styles and architecture patterns):
• Simple CRUD, single-tier, single-layer.
100 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


• Traditional N-Layered.
• Domain-Driven Design N-layered.
• Clean Architecture (as used with eShopOnWeb)
• Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).
• Event-Driven Architecture (EDA).
You can also build microservices with many technologies and languages, such as ASP.NET Core Web
APIs, NancyFx, ASP.NET Core SignalR (available with .NET Core 2 or later), F#, Node.js, Python, Java,
C++, GoLang, and more.
The important point is that no particular architecture pattern or style, nor any particular technology, is
right for all situations. Figure 6-3 shows some approaches and technologies (although not in any
particular order) that could be used in different microservices.
Figure 6-3. Multi-architectural patterns and the polyglot microservices world
Multi-architectural pattern and polyglot microservices means you can mix and match languages and
technologies to the needs of each microservice and still have them talking to each other. As shown in
Figure 6-3, in applications composed of many microservices (Bounded Contexts in domain-driven
design terminology, or simply “subsystems” as autonomous microservices), you might implement
each microservice in a different way. Each might have a different architecture pattern and use different
languages and databases depending on the application’s nature, business requirements, and
priorities. In some cases, the microservices might be similar. But that is not usually the case, because
each subsystem’s context boundary and requirements are usually different.
101 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


For instance, for a simple CRUD maintenance application, it might not make sense to design and
implement DDD patterns. But for your core domain or core business, you might need to apply more
advanced patterns to tackle business complexity with ever-changing business rules.
Especially when you deal with large applications composed by multiple subsystems, you should not
apply a single top-level architecture based on a single architecture pattern. For instance, CQRS should
not be applied as a top-level architecture for a whole application, but might be useful for a specific set
of services.
There is no silver bullet or a right architecture pattern for every given case. You cannot have “one
architecture pattern to rule them all.” Depending on the priorities of each microservice, you must
choose a different approach for each, as explained in the following sections.
Creating a simple data-driven CRUD microservice
This section outlines how to create a simple microservice that performs create, read, update, and
delete (CRUD) operations on a data source.
Designing a simple CRUD microservice
From a design point of view, this type of containerized microservice is very simple. Perhaps the
problem to solve is simple, or perhaps the implementation is only a proof of concept.
Figure 6-4. Internal design for simple CRUD microservices
An example of this kind of simple data-drive service is the catalog microservice from the
eShopOnContainers sample application. This type of service implements all its functionality in a single
ASP.NET Core Web API project that includes classes for its data model, its business logic, and its data
access code. It also stores its related data in a database running in SQL Server (as another container
for dev/test purposes), but could also be any regular SQL Server host, as shown in Figure 6-5.
102 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


Figure 6-5. Simple data-driven/CRUD microservice design
The previous diagram shows the logical Catalog microservice, that includes its Catalog database,
which can be or not in the same Docker host. Having the database in the same Docker host might be
good for development, but not for production. When you are developing this kind of service, you only
need ASP.NET Core and a data-access API or ORM like Entity Framework Core. You could also
generate Swagger metadata automatically through Swashbuckle to provide a description of what your
service offers, as explained in the next section.
Note that running a database server like SQL Server within a Docker container is great for
development environments, because you can have all your dependencies up and running without
needing to provision a database in the cloud or on-premises. This approach is convenient when
running integration tests. However, for production environments, running a database server in a
container is not recommended, because you usually do not get high availability with that approach.
For a production environment in Azure, it is recommended that you use Azure SQL DB or any other
database technology that can provide high availability and high scalability. For example, for a NoSQL
approach, you might choose CosmosDB.
Finally, by editing the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml metadata files, you can configure how the
image of this container will be created—what base image it will use, plus design settings such as
internal and external names and TCP ports.
Implementing a simple CRUD microservice with ASP.NET Core
To implement a simple CRUD microservice using .NET and Visual Studio, you start by creating a
simple ASP.NET Core Web API project (running on .NET so it can run on a Linux Docker host), as
shown in Figure 6-6.
103 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


Figure 6-6. Creating an ASP.NET Core Web API project in Visual Studio 2019
To create an ASP.NET Core Web API Project, first select an ASP.NET Core Web Application and then
select the API type. After creating the project, you can implement your MVC controllers as you would
in any other Web API project, using the Entity Framework API or other API. In a new Web API project,
you can see that the only dependency you have in that microservice is on ASP.NET Core itself.
Internally, within the Microsoft.AspNetCore.All dependency, it is referencing Entity Framework and
many other .NET NuGet packages, as shown in Figure 6-7.
104 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


Figure 6-7. Dependencies in a simple CRUD Web API microservice
The API project includes references to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App NuGet package, that includes
references to all essential packages. It could include some other packages as well.
Implementing CRUD Web API services with Entity Framework Core
Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform version of the popular
Entity Framework data access technology. EF Core is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables
.NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects.
The catalog microservice uses EF and the SQL Server provider because its database is running in a
container with the SQL Server for Linux Docker image. However, the database could be deployed into
105 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications



---

any SQL Server, such as Windows on-premises or Azure SQL DB. The only thing you would need to
change is the connection string in the ASP.NET Web API microservice.
The data model
With EF Core, data access is performed by using a model. A model is made up of (domain model)
entity classes and a derived context (DbContext) that represents a session with the database, allowing
you to query and save data. You can generate a model from an existing database, manually code a
model to match your database, or use EF migrations technique to create a database from your model,
using the code-first approach (that makes it easy to evolve the database as your model changes over
time). For the catalog microservice, the last approach has been used. You can see an example of the
CatalogItem entity class in the following code example, which is a simple Plain Old Class Object
(POCO) entity class.
public class CatalogItem
{
public int Id { get; set; }
public string Name { get; set; }
public string Description { get; set; }
public decimal Price { get; set; }
public string PictureFileName { get; set; }
public string PictureUri { get; set; }
public int CatalogTypeId { get; set; }
public CatalogType CatalogType { get; set; }
public int CatalogBrandId { get; set; }
public CatalogBrand CatalogBrand { get; set; }
public int AvailableStock { get; set; }
public int RestockThreshold { get; set; }
public int MaxStockThreshold { get; set; }
public bool OnReorder { get; set; }
public CatalogItem() { }
// Additional code ...
}
You also need a DbContext that represents a session with the database. For the catalog microservice,
the CatalogContext class derives from the DbContext base class, as shown in the following example:
public class CatalogContext : DbContext
{
public CatalogContext(DbContextOptions<CatalogContext> options) : base(options)
{ }
public DbSet<CatalogItem> CatalogItems { get; set; }
public DbSet<CatalogBrand> CatalogBrands { get; set; }
public DbSet<CatalogType> CatalogTypes { get; set; }
// Additional code ...
}
You can have additional DbContext implementations. For example, in the sample Catalog.API
microservice, there’s a second DbContext named CatalogContextSeed where it automatically
populates the sample data the first time it tries to access the database. This method is useful for demo
data and for automated testing scenarios, as well.
106 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Within the DbContext, you use the OnModelCreating method to customize object/database entity
mappings and other EF extensibility points.
Querying data from Web API controllers
Instances of your entity classes are typically retrieved from the database using Language-Integrated
Query (LINQ), as shown in the following example:
[Route("api/v1/[controller]")]
public class CatalogController : ControllerBase
{
private readonly CatalogContext _catalogContext;
private readonly CatalogSettings _settings;
private readonly ICatalogIntegrationEventService _catalogIntegrationEventService;
public CatalogController(
CatalogContext context,
IOptionsSnapshot<CatalogSettings> settings,
ICatalogIntegrationEventService catalogIntegrationEventService)
{
_catalogContext = context ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
_catalogIntegrationEventService = catalogIntegrationEventService
?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(catalogIntegrationEventService));
_settings = settings.Value;
context.ChangeTracker.QueryTrackingBehavior = QueryTrackingBehavior.NoTracking;
}
// GET api/v1/[controller]/items[?pageSize=3&pageIndex=10]
[HttpGet]
[Route("items")]
[ProducesResponseType(typeof(PaginatedItemsViewModel<CatalogItem>),
(int)HttpStatusCode.OK)]
[ProducesResponseType(typeof(IEnumerable<CatalogItem>), (int)HttpStatusCode.OK)]
[ProducesResponseType((int)HttpStatusCode.BadRequest)]
public async Task<IActionResult> ItemsAsync(
[FromQuery]int pageSize = 10,
[FromQuery]int pageIndex = 0,
string ids = null)
{
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(ids))
{
var items = await GetItemsByIdsAsync(ids);
if (!items.Any())
{
return BadRequest("ids value invalid. Must be comma-separated list of
numbers");
}
return Ok(items);
}
var totalItems = await _catalogContext.CatalogItems
.LongCountAsync();
var itemsOnPage = await _catalogContext.CatalogItems
.OrderBy(c => c.Name)
.Skip(pageSize * pageIndex)
107 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

.Take(pageSize)
.ToListAsync();
itemsOnPage = ChangeUriPlaceholder(itemsOnPage);
var model = new PaginatedItemsViewModel<CatalogItem>(
pageIndex, pageSize, totalItems, itemsOnPage);
return Ok(model);
}
//...
}
Saving data
Data is created, deleted, and modified in the database using instances of your entity classes. You
could add code like the following hard-coded example (mock data, in this case) to your Web API
controllers.
var catalogItem = new CatalogItem() {CatalogTypeId=2, CatalogBrandId=2,
Name="Roslyn T-Shirt", Price = 12};
_context.Catalog.Add(catalogItem);
_context.SaveChanges();
Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core and Web API controllers
In ASP.NET Core, you can use Dependency Injection (DI) out of the box. You do not need to set up a
third-party Inversion of Control (IoC) container, although you can plug your preferred IoC container
into the ASP.NET Core infrastructure if you want. In this case, it means that you can directly inject the
required EF DBContext or additional repositories through the controller constructor.
In the CatalogController class mentioned earlier, CatalogContext (which inherits from DbContext) type
is injected along with the other required objects in the CatalogController() constructor.
An important configuration to set up in the Web API project is the DbContext class registration into
the service’s IoC container. You typically do so in the Program.cs file by calling the
builder.Services.AddDbContext<CatalogContext>() method, as shown in the following simplified
example:
// Additional code...
builder.Services.AddDbContext<CatalogContext>(options =>
{
options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration["ConnectionString"],
sqlServerOptionsAction: sqlOptions =>
{
sqlOptions.MigrationsAssembly(
typeof(Program).GetTypeInfo().Assembly.GetName().Name);
//Configuring Connection Resiliency:
sqlOptions.
EnableRetryOnFailure(maxRetryCount: 5,
maxRetryDelay: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30),
errorNumbersToAdd: null);
});
108 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

// Changing default behavior when client evaluation occurs to throw.
// Default in EFCore would be to log warning when client evaluation is done.
options.ConfigureWarnings(warnings => warnings.Throw(
RelationalEventId.QueryClientEvaluationWarning));
});

The DB connection string and environment variables used by Docker
containers
You can use the ASP.NET Core settings and add a ConnectionString property to your settings.json file
as shown in the following example:
{
"ConnectionString": "Server=tcp:127.0.0.1,5433;Initial
Catalog=Microsoft.eShopOnContainers.Services.CatalogDb;User Id=sa;Password=[PLACEHOLDER]",
"ExternalCatalogBaseUrl": "http://host.docker.internal:5101",
"Logging": {
"IncludeScopes": false,
"LogLevel": {
"Default": "Debug",
"System": "Information",
"Microsoft": "Information"
}
}
}
The settings.json file can have default values for the ConnectionString property or for any other
property. However, those properties will be overridden by the values of environment variables that
you specify in the docker-compose.override.yml file, when using Docker.
From your docker-compose.yml or docker-compose.override.yml files, you can initialize those
environment variables so that Docker will set them up as OS environment variables for you, as shown
in the following docker-compose.override.yml file (the connection string and other lines wrap in this
example, but it would not wrap in your own file).
# docker-compose.override.yml
#
catalog-api:
environment:
-
ConnectionString=Server=sqldata;Database=Microsoft.eShopOnContainers.Services.CatalogDb;Use
r Id=sa;Password=[PLACEHOLDER]
# Additional environment variables for this service
ports:
- "5101:80"
109 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

The docker-compose.yml files at the solution level are not only more flexible than configuration files
at the project or microservice level, but also more secure if you override the environment variables
declared at the docker-compose files with values set from your deployment tools, like from Azure
DevOps Services Docker deployment tasks.
Finally, you can get that value from your code by using builder.Configuration\["ConnectionString"\], as
shown in an earlier code example.
However, for production environments, you might want to explore additional ways on how to store
secrets like the connection strings. An excellent way to manage application secrets is using Azure Key
Vault.
Azure Key Vault helps to store and safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets used by your cloud
applications and services. A secret is anything you want to keep strict control of, like API keys,
connection strings, passwords, etc. and strict control includes usage logging, setting expiration,
managing access, among others.
Azure Key Vault allows a detailed control level of the application secrets usage without the need to let
anyone know them. The secrets can even be rotated for enhanced security without disrupting
development or operations.
Applications have to be registered in the organization’s Active Directory, so they can use the Key
Vault.
You can check the Key Vault Concepts documentation for more details.
Implementing versioning in ASP.NET Web APIs
As business requirements change, new collections of resources may be added, the relationships
between resources might change, and the structure of the data in resources might be amended.
Updating a Web API to handle new requirements is a relatively straightforward process, but you must
consider the effects that such changes will have on client applications consuming the Web API.
Although the developer designing and implementing a Web API has full control over that API, the
developer does not have the same degree of control over client applications that might be built by
third-party organizations operating remotely.
Versioning enables a Web API to indicate the features and resources that it exposes. A client
application can then submit requests to a specific version of a feature or resource. There are several
approaches to implement versioning:
• URI versioning
• Query string versioning
• Header versioning
Query string and URI versioning are the simplest to implement. Header versioning is a good
approach. However, header versioning is not as explicit and straightforward as URI versioning.
Because URL versioning is the simplest and most explicit, the eShopOnContainers sample application
uses URI versioning.
110 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

With URI versioning, as in the eShopOnContainers sample application, each time you modify the Web
API or change the schema of resources, you add a version number to the URI for each resource.
Existing URIs should continue to operate as before, returning resources that conform to the schema
that matches the requested version.
As shown in the following code example, the version can be set by using the Route attribute in the
Web API controller, which makes the version explicit in the URI (v1 in this case).
[Route("api/v1/[controller]")]
public class CatalogController : ControllerBase
{
// Implementation ...
This versioning mechanism is simple and depends on the server routing the request to the
appropriate endpoint. However, for a more sophisticated versioning and the best method when using
REST, you should use hypermedia and implement HATEOAS (Hypertext as the Engine of Application
State).

Generating Swagger description metadata from your ASP.NET Core
Web API
Swagger is a commonly used open source framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps
you design, build, document, and consume your RESTful APIs. It is becoming the standard for the APIs
description metadata domain. You should include Swagger description metadata with any kind of
microservice, either data-driven microservices or more advanced domain-driven microservices (as
explained in the following section).
The heart of Swagger is the Swagger specification, which is API description metadata in a JSON or
YAML file. The specification creates the RESTful contract for your API, detailing all its resources and
operations in both a human- and machine-readable format for easy development, discovery, and
integration.
The specification is the basis of the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) and is developed in an open,
transparent, and collaborative community to standardize the way RESTful interfaces are defined.
111 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

The specification defines the structure for how a service can be discovered and how its capabilities
understood. For more information, including a web editor and examples of Swagger specifications
from companies like Spotify, Uber, Slack, and Microsoft, see the Swagger site (https://swagger.io).
Why use Swagger?
The main reasons to generate Swagger metadata for your APIs are the following.
Ability for other products to automatically consume and integrate your APIs. Dozens of products
and commercial tools and many libraries and frameworks support Swagger. Microsoft has high-level
products and tools that can automatically consume Swagger-based APIs, such as the following:
• AutoRest. You can automatically generate .NET client classes for calling Swagger. This tool can
be used from the CLI and it also integrates with Visual Studio for easy use through the GUI.
• Microsoft Flow. You can automatically use and integrate your API into a high-level Microsoft
Flow workflow, with no programming skills required.
• Microsoft PowerApps. You can automatically consume your API from PowerApps mobile apps
built with PowerApps Studio, with no programming skills required.
• Azure App Service Logic Apps. You can automatically use and integrate your API into an Azure
App Service Logic App, with no programming skills required.
Ability to automatically generate API documentation. When you create large-scale RESTful APIs,
such as complex microservice-based applications, you need to handle many endpoints with different
data models used in the request and response payloads. Having proper documentation and having a
solid API explorer, as you get with Swagger, is key for the success of your API and adoption by
developers.
Swagger’s metadata is what Microsoft Flow, PowerApps, and Azure Logic Apps use to understand how
to use APIs and connect to them.
There are several options to automate Swagger metadata generation for ASP.NET Core REST API
applications, in the form of functional API help pages, based on swagger-ui.
Probably the best know is Swashbuckle, which is currently used in eShopOnContainers and we’ll cover
in some detail in this guide but there’s also the option to use NSwag, which can generate Typescript
and C# API clients, as well as C# controllers, from a Swagger or OpenAPI specification and even by
scanning the .dll that contains the controllers, using NSwagStudio.
How to automate API Swagger metadata generation with the Swashbuckle NuGet
package
Generating Swagger metadata manually (in a JSON or YAML file) can be tedious work. However, you
can automate API discovery of ASP.NET Web API services by using the Swashbuckle NuGet package to
dynamically generate Swagger API metadata.
Swashbuckle automatically generates Swagger metadata for your ASP.NET Web API projects. It
supports ASP.NET Core Web API projects and the traditional ASP.NET Web API and any other flavor,
112 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

such as Azure API App, Azure Mobile App, Azure Service Fabric microservices based on ASP.NET. It
also supports plain Web API deployed on containers, as in for the reference application.
Swashbuckle combines API Explorer and Swagger or swagger-ui to provide a rich discovery and
documentation experience for your API consumers. In addition to its Swagger metadata generator
engine, Swashbuckle also contains an embedded version of swagger-ui, which it will automatically
serve up once Swashbuckle is installed.
This means you can complement your API with a nice discovery UI to help developers to use your API.
It requires a small amount of code and maintenance because it is automatically generated, allowing
you to focus on building your API. The result for the API Explorer looks like Figure 6-8.
Figure 6-8. Swashbuckle API Explorer based on Swagger metadata—eShopOnContainers catalog microservice
The Swashbuckle generated Swagger UI API documentation includes all published actions. The API
explorer is not the most important thing here. Once you have a Web API that can describe itself in
Swagger metadata, your API can be used seamlessly from Swagger-based tools, including client
proxy-class code generators that can target many platforms. For example, as mentioned, AutoRest
automatically generates .NET client classes. But additional tools like swagger-codegen are also
available, which allow code generation of API client libraries, server stubs, and documentation
automatically.
Currently, Swashbuckle consists of five internal NuGet packages under the high-level metapackage
Swashbuckle.AspNetCore for ASP.NET Core applications.
After you have installed these NuGet packages in your Web API project, you need to configure
Swagger in the Program.cs class, as in the following simplified code:
// Add framework services.
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen(options =>
{
113 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


options.DescribeAllEnumsAsStrings();
options.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo
{
Title = "eShopOnContainers - Catalog HTTP API",
Version = "v1",
Description = "The Catalog Microservice HTTP API. This is a Data-Driven/CRUD
microservice sample"
});
});
// Other startup code...
app.UseSwagger()
.UseSwaggerUI(c =>
{
c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "My API V1");
});
```
:::
Once this is done, you can start your application and browse the following Swagger JSON and
UI endpoints using URLs like these:
:::{custom-style=CodeBox}
```console
http://<your-root-url>/swagger/v1/swagger.json
http://<your-root-url>/swagger/
You previously saw the generated UI created by Swashbuckle for a URL like http://<your-root-
url>/swagger. In Figure 6-9, you can also see how you can test any API method.
114 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Figure 6-9. Swashbuckle UI testing the Catalog/Items API method
The Swagger UI API detail shows a sample of the response and can be used to execute the real API,
which is great for developer discovery. Figure 6-10 shows the Swagger JSON metadata generated
from the eShopOnContainers microservice (which is what the tools use underneath) when you request
http://<your-root-url>/swagger/v1/swagger.json using Postman.
115 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications



---

Figure 6-10. Swagger JSON metadata
It is that simple. And because it is automatically generated, the Swagger metadata will grow when you
add more functionality to your API.

Defining your multi-container application with
docker-compose.yml
In this guide, the docker-compose.yml file was introduced in the section Step 4. Define your services
in docker-compose.yml when building a multi-container Docker application. However, there are
additional ways to use the docker-compose files that are worth exploring in further detail.
For example, you can explicitly describe how you want to deploy your multi-container application in
the docker-compose.yml file. Optionally, you can also describe how you are going to build your
custom Docker images. (Custom Docker images can also be built with the Docker CLI.)
116 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


Basically, you define each of the containers you want to deploy plus certain characteristics for each
container deployment. Once you have a multi-container deployment description file, you can deploy
the whole solution in a single action orchestrated by the docker-compose up CLI command, or you
can deploy it transparently from Visual Studio. Otherwise, you would need to use the Docker CLI to
deploy container-by-container in multiple steps by using the docker run command from the
command line. Therefore, each service defined in docker-compose.yml must specify exactly one
image or build. Other keys are optional, and are analogous to their docker run command-line
counterparts.
The following YAML code is the definition of a possible global but single docker-compose.yml file for
the eShopOnContainers sample. This code is not the actual docker-compose file from
eShopOnContainers. Instead, it is a simplified and consolidated version in a single file, which is not the
best way to work with docker-compose files, as will be explained later.

The root key in this file is services. Under that key, you define the services you want to deploy and run
when you execute the docker-compose up command or when you deploy from Visual Studio by using
this docker-compose.yml file. In this case, the docker-compose.yml file has multiple services defined,
as described in the following table.
Service name Description
webmvc Container including the ASP.NET Core MVC
application consuming the microservices from
server-side C#
catalog-api Container including the Catalog ASP.NET Core
Web API microservice
ordering-api Container including the Ordering ASP.NET
Core Web API microservice
sqldata Container running SQL Server for Linux,
holding the microservices databases
basket-api Container with the Basket ASP.NET Core Web
API microservice
basketdata Container running the REDIS cache service,
with the basket database as a REDIS cache
A simple Web Service API container
Focusing on a single container, the catalog-api container-microservice has a straightforward
definition:
catalog-api:
image: eshop/catalog-api
environment:
- ConnectionString=Server=sqldata;Initial Catalog=CatalogData;User
Id=sa;Password=[PLACEHOLDER]
expose:
118 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

- "80"
ports:
- "5101:80"
#extra hosts can be used for standalone SQL Server or services at the dev PC
extra_hosts:
- "CESARDLSURFBOOK:10.0.75.1"
depends_on:
- sqldata
This containerized service has the following basic configuration:
• It is based on the custom eshop/catalog-api image. For simplicity’s sake, there is no
build: key setting in the file. This means that the image must have been previously built (with
docker build) or have been downloaded (with the docker pull command) from any Docker
registry.
• It defines an environment variable named ConnectionString with the connection string to be
used by Entity Framework to access the SQL Server instance that contains the catalog data
model. In this case, the same SQL Server container is holding multiple databases. Therefore,
you need less memory in your development machine for Docker. However, you could also
deploy one SQL Server container for each microservice database.
• The SQL Server name is sqldata, which is the same name used for the container that is
running the SQL Server instance for Linux. This is convenient; being able to use this name
resolution (internal to the Docker host) will resolve the network address so you don’t need to
know the internal IP for the containers you are accessing from other containers.
Because the connection string is defined by an environment variable, you could set that variable
through a different mechanism and at a different time. For example, you could set a different
connection string when deploying to production in the final hosts, or by doing it from your CI/CD
pipelines in Azure DevOps Services or your preferred DevOps system.
• It exposes port 80 for internal access to the catalog-api service within the Docker host. The
host is currently a Linux VM because it is based on a Docker image for Linux, but you could
configure the container to run on a Windows image instead.
• It forwards the exposed port 80 on the container to port 5101 on the Docker host machine
(the Linux VM).
• It links the web service to the sqldata service (the SQL Server instance for Linux database
running in a container). When you specify this dependency, the catalog-api container will not
start until the sqldata container has already started; this aspect is important because catalog-
api needs to have the SQL Server database up and running first. However, this kind of
container dependency is not enough in many cases, because Docker checks only at the
container level. Sometimes the service (in this case SQL Server) might still not be ready, so it is
advisable to implement retry logic with exponential backoff in your client microservices. That
way, if a dependency container is not ready for a short time, the application will still be
resilient.
• It is configured to allow access to external servers: the extra_hosts setting allows you to access
external servers or machines outside of the Docker host (that is, outside the default Linux VM,
119 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

which is a development Docker host), such as a local SQL Server instance on your
development PC.
There are also other, more advanced docker-compose.yml settings that we’ll discuss in the following
sections.
Using docker-compose files to target multiple environments
The docker-compose.*.yml files are definition files and can be used by multiple infrastructures that
understand that format. The most straightforward tool is the docker-compose command.
Therefore, by using the docker-compose command you can target the following main scenarios.
Development environments
When you develop applications, it is important to be able to run an application in an isolated
development environment. You can use the docker-compose CLI command to create that
environment or Visual Studio, which uses docker-compose under the covers.
The docker-compose.yml file allows you to configure and document all your application’s service
dependencies (other services, cache, databases, queues, etc.). Using the docker-compose CLI
command, you can create and start one or more containers for each dependency with a single
command (docker-compose up).
The docker-compose.yml files are configuration files interpreted by Docker engine but also serve as
convenient documentation files about the composition of your multi-container application.
Testing environments
An important part of any continuous deployment (CD) or continuous integration (CI) process are the
unit tests and integration tests. These automated tests require an isolated environment so they are
not impacted by the users or any other change in the application’s data.
With Docker Compose, you can create and destroy that isolated environment very easily in a few
commands from your command prompt or scripts, like the following commands:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-test.override.yml up -d
./run_unit_tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-test.override.yml down
Production deployments
You can also use Compose to deploy to a remote Docker Engine. A typical case is to deploy to a
single Docker host instance (like a production VM or server provisioned with Docker Machine).
If you are using any other orchestrator (Azure Service Fabric, Kubernetes, etc.), you might need to add
setup and metadata configuration settings like those in docker-compose.yml, but in the format
required by the other orchestrator.
In any case, docker-compose is a convenient tool and metadata format for development, testing and
production workflows, although the production workflow might vary on the orchestrator you are
using.
120 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Using multiple docker-compose files to handle several environments
When targeting different environments, you should use multiple compose files. This approach lets you
create multiple configuration variants depending on the environment.
Overriding the base docker-compose file
You could use a single docker-compose.yml file as in the simplified examples shown in previous
sections. However, that is not recommended for most applications.
By default, Compose reads two files, a docker-compose.yml and an optional docker-
compose.override.yml file. As shown in Figure 6-11, when you are using Visual Studio and enabling
Docker support, Visual Studio also creates an additional docker-compose.vs.debug.g.yml file for
debugging the application, you can take a look at this file in folder obj\Docker\ in the main solution
folder.
Figure 6-11. docker-compose files in Visual Studio 2019
docker-compose project file structure:
• .dockerignore - used to ignore files
• docker-compose.yml - used to compose microservices
• docker-compose.override.yml - used to configure microservices environment
You can edit the docker-compose files with any editor, like Visual Studio Code or Sublime, and run the
application with the docker-compose up command.
By convention, the docker-compose.yml file contains your base configuration and other static
settings. That means that the service configuration should not change depending on the deployment
environment you are targeting.
The docker-compose.override.yml file, as its name suggests, contains configuration settings that
override the base configuration, such as configuration that depends on the deployment environment.
You can have multiple override files with different names also. The override files usually contain
additional information needed by the application but specific to an environment or to a deployment.
Targeting multiple environments
A typical use case is when you define multiple compose files so you can target multiple environments,
like production, staging, CI, or development. To support these differences, you can split your
Compose configuration into multiple files, as shown in Figure 6-12.
121 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


Figure 6-12. Multiple docker-compose files overriding values in the base docker-compose.yml file
You can combine multiple docker-compose*.yml files to handle different environments. You start with
the base docker-compose.yml file. This base file contains the base or static configuration settings that
do not change depending on the environment. For example, the eShopOnContainers app has the
following docker-compose.yml file (simplified with fewer services) as the base file.
#docker-compose.yml (Base)
version: '3.4'
services:
basket-api:
image: eshop/basket-api:${TAG:-latest}
build:
context: .
dockerfile: src/Services/Basket/Basket.API/Dockerfile

122 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

dockerfile: src/Web/WebMVC/Dockerfile
depends_on:
- catalog-api
- ordering-api
- identity-api

sqldata:
image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
nosqldata:
image: mongo
basketdata:
image: redis
rabbitmq:
image: rabbitmq:3-management
The values in the base docker-compose.yml file should not change because of different target
deployment environments.
If you focus on the webmvc service definition, for instance, you can see how that information is much
the same no matter what environment you might be targeting. You have the following information:
• The service name: webmvc.
• The container’s custom image: eshop/webmvc.
• The command to build the custom Docker image, indicating which Dockerfile to use.
• Dependencies on other services, so this container does not start until the other dependency
containers have started.
You can have additional configuration, but the important point is that in the base docker-
compose.yml file, you just want to set the information that is common across environments. Then in
the docker-compose.override.yml or similar files for production or staging, you should place
configuration that is specific for each environment.
Usually, the docker-compose.override.yml is used for your development environment, as in the
following example from eShopOnContainers:
#docker-compose.override.yml (Extended config for DEVELOPMENT env.)
version: '3.4'
services:
# Simplified number of services here:

In this example, the development override configuration exposes some ports to the host, defines
environment variables with redirect URLs, and specifies connection strings for the development
environment. These settings are all just for the development environment.
When you run docker-compose up (or launch it from Visual Studio), the command reads the overrides
automatically as if it were merging both files.
Suppose that you want another Compose file for the production environment, with different
configuration values, ports, or connection strings. You can create another override file, like file named
docker-compose.prod.yml with different settings and environment variables. That file might be stored
in a different Git repo or managed and secured by a different team.
How to deploy with a specific override file
To use multiple override files, or an override file with a different name, you can use the -f option with
the docker-compose command and specify the files. Compose merges files in the order they are
specified on the command line. The following example shows how to deploy with override files.
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
125 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


---

Using environment variables in docker-compose files
It is convenient, especially in production environments, to be able to get configuration information
from environment variables, as we have shown in previous examples. You can reference an
environment variable in your docker-compose files using the syntax ${MY_VAR}. The following line
from a docker-compose.prod.yml file shows how to reference the value of an environment variable.
IdentityUrl=http://${ESHOP_PROD_EXTERNAL_DNS_NAME_OR_IP}:5105
Environment variables are created and initialized in different ways, depending on your host
environment (Linux, Windows, Cloud cluster, etc.). However, a convenient approach is to use an .env
file. The docker-compose files support declaring default environment variables in the .env file. These
values for the environment variables are the default values. But they can be overridden by the values
you might have defined in each of your environments (host OS or environment variables from your
cluster). You place this .env file in the folder where the docker-compose command is executed from.
The following example shows an .env file like the .env file for the eShopOnContainers application.
# .env file
ESHOP_EXTERNAL_DNS_NAME_OR_IP=host.docker.internal
ESHOP_PROD_EXTERNAL_DNS_NAME_OR_IP=10.121.122.92
Docker-compose expects each line in an .env file to be in the format <variable>=<value>.
The values set in the run-time environment always override the values defined inside the .env file. In a
similar way, values passed via command-line arguments also override the default values set in the .env
file.

Building optimized ASP.NET Core Docker images
If you are exploring Docker and .NET on sources on the Internet, you will find Dockerfiles that
demonstrate the simplicity of building a Docker image by copying your source into a container. These
examples suggest that by using a simple configuration, you can have a Docker image with the
environment packaged with your application. The following example shows a simple Dockerfile in this
vein.
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0
WORKDIR /app
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS http://+:80
EXPOSE 80
COPY . .
RUN dotnet restore
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "run"]
126 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

A Dockerfile like this will work. However, you can substantially optimize your images, especially your
production images.
In the container and microservices model, you are constantly starting containers. The typical way of
using containers does not restart a sleeping container, because the container is disposable.
Orchestrators (like Kubernetes and Azure Service Fabric) create new instances of images. What this
means is that you would need to optimize by precompiling the application when it is built so the
instantiation process will be faster. When the container is started, it should be ready to run. Don’t
restore and compile at run time using the dotnet restore and dotnet build CLI commands as you may
see in blog posts about .NET and Docker.
The .NET team has been doing important work to make .NET and ASP.NET Core a container-optimized
framework. Not only is .NET a lightweight framework with a small memory footprint; the team has
focused on optimized Docker images for three main scenarios and published them in the Docker Hub
registry at dotnet/, beginning with version 2.1:
1. Development: The priority is the ability to quickly iterate and debug changes, and where size
is secondary.
2. Build: The priority is compiling the application, and the image includes binaries and other
dependencies to optimize binaries.
3. Production: The focus is fast deploying and starting of containers, so these images are
limited to the binaries and content needed to run the application.
The .NET team provides four basic variants in dotnet/ (at Docker Hub):
1. sdk: for development and build scenarios
2. aspnet: for ASP.NET production scenarios
3. runtime: for .NET production scenarios
4. runtime-deps: for production scenarios of self-contained applications
For faster startup, runtime images also automatically set aspnetcore_urls to port 80 and use Ngen to
create a native image cache of assemblies.

Use a database server running as a container
You can have your databases (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) on regular standalone servers, in
on-premises clusters, or in PaaS services in the cloud like Azure SQL DB. However, for development
and test environments, having your databases running as containers is convenient, because you don’t
127 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

have any external dependency and simply running the docker-compose up command starts the whole
application. Having those databases as containers is also great for integration tests, because the
database is started in the container and is always populated with the same sample data, so tests can
be more predictable.
SQL Server running as a container with a microservice-related
database
In eShopOnContainers, there’s a container named sqldata, as defined in the docker-compose.yml file,
that runs a SQL Server for Linux instance with the SQL databases for all microservices that need one.
A key point in microservices is that each microservice owns its related data, so it should have its own
database. However, the databases can be anywhere. In this case, they are all in the same container to
keep Docker memory requirements as low as possible. Keep in mind that this is a good-enough
solution for development and, perhaps, testing but not for production.
The SQL Server container in the sample application is configured with the following YAML code in the
docker-compose.yml file, which is executed when you run docker-compose up. Note that the YAML
code has consolidated configuration information from the generic docker-compose.yml file and the
docker-compose.override.yml file. (Usually you would separate the environment settings from the
base or static information related to the SQL Server image.)
sqldata:
image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
environment:
- SA_PASSWORD=Pass@word
- ACCEPT_EULA=Y
ports:
- "5434:1433"
In a similar way, instead of using docker-compose, the following docker run command can run that
container:
docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=Pass@word' -p 5433:1433 -d
mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
However, if you are deploying a multi-container application like eShopOnContainers, it is more
convenient to use the docker-compose up command so that it deploys all the required containers for
the application.
When you start this SQL Server container for the first time, the container initializes SQL Server with the
password that you provide. Once SQL Server is running as a container, you can update the database
by connecting through any regular SQL connection, such as from SQL Server Management Studio,
Visual Studio, or C# code.
The eShopOnContainers application initializes each microservice database with sample data by
seeding it with data on startup, as explained in the following section.
Having SQL Server running as a container is not just useful for a demo where you might not have
access to an instance of SQL Server. As noted, it is also great for development and testing
128 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

environments so that you can easily run integration tests starting from a clean SQL Server image and
known data by seeding new sample data.

Seeding with test data on Web application startup
To add data to the database when the application starts up, you can add code like the following to
the Main method in the Program class of the Web API project:
public static int Main(string[] args)
{
var configuration = GetConfiguration();
Log.Logger = CreateSerilogLogger(configuration);
try
{
Log.Information("Configuring web host ({ApplicationContext})...", AppName);
var host = CreateHostBuilder(configuration, args);
Log.Information("Applying migrations ({ApplicationContext})...", AppName);
host.MigrateDbContext<CatalogContext>((context, services) =>
{
var env = services.GetService<IWebHostEnvironment>();
var settings = services.GetService<IOptions<CatalogSettings>>();
var logger = services.GetService<ILogger<CatalogContextSeed>>();
new CatalogContextSeed()
.SeedAsync(context, env, settings, logger)
.Wait();
})
.MigrateDbContext<IntegrationEventLogContext>((_, __) => { });
Log.Information("Starting web host ({ApplicationContext})...", AppName);
host.Run();
return 0;
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
Log.Fatal(ex, "Program terminated unexpectedly ({ApplicationContext})!", AppName);
return 1;
}
finally
{
Log.CloseAndFlush();
}
}
129 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

There’s an important caveat when applying migrations and seeding a database during container
startup. Since the database server might not be available for whatever reason, you must handle retries
while waiting for the server to be available. This retry logic is handled by the MigrateDbContext()
extension method, as shown in the following code:
public static IWebHost MigrateDbContext<TContext>(
this IWebHost host,
Action<TContext,
IServiceProvider> seeder)
where TContext : DbContext
{
var underK8s = host.IsInKubernetes();
using (var scope = host.Services.CreateScope())
{
var services = scope.ServiceProvider;
var logger = services.GetRequiredService<ILogger<TContext>>();
var context = services.GetService<TContext>();
try
{
logger.LogInformation("Migrating database associated with context
{DbContextName}", typeof(TContext).Name);
if (underK8s)
{
InvokeSeeder(seeder, context, services);
}
else
{
var retry = Policy.Handle<SqlException>()
.WaitAndRetry(new TimeSpan[]
{
TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3),
TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
TimeSpan.FromSeconds(8),
});
//if the sql server container is not created on run docker compose this
//migration can't fail for network related exception. The retry options for
DbContext only
//apply to transient exceptions
// Note that this is NOT applied when running some orchestrators (let the
orchestrator to recreate the failing service)
retry.Execute(() => InvokeSeeder(seeder, context, services));
}
logger.LogInformation("Migrated database associated with context
{DbContextName}", typeof(TContext).Name);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred while migrating the database used on
context {DbContextName}", typeof(TContext).Name);
if (underK8s)
{
throw; // Rethrow under k8s because we rely on k8s to re-run the
130 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

pod
}
}
}
return host;
}
The following code in the custom CatalogContextSeed class populates the data.
public class CatalogContextSeed
{
public static async Task SeedAsync(IApplicationBuilder applicationBuilder)
{
var context = (CatalogContext)applicationBuilder
.ApplicationServices.GetService(typeof(CatalogContext));
using (context)
{
context.Database.Migrate();
if (!context.CatalogBrands.Any())
{
context.CatalogBrands.AddRange(
GetPreconfiguredCatalogBrands());
await context.SaveChangesAsync();
}
if (!context.CatalogTypes.Any())
{
context.CatalogTypes.AddRange(
GetPreconfiguredCatalogTypes());
await context.SaveChangesAsync();
}
}
}
static IEnumerable<CatalogBrand> GetPreconfiguredCatalogBrands()
{
return new List<CatalogBrand>()
{
new CatalogBrand() { Brand = "Azure"},
new CatalogBrand() { Brand = ".NET" },
new CatalogBrand() { Brand = "Visual Studio" },
new CatalogBrand() { Brand = "SQL Server" }
};
}
static IEnumerable<CatalogType> GetPreconfiguredCatalogTypes()
{
return new List<CatalogType>()
{
new CatalogType() { Type = "Mug"},
new CatalogType() { Type = "T-Shirt" },
new CatalogType() { Type = "Backpack" },
new CatalogType() { Type = "USB Memory Stick" }
};
}
}
When you run integration tests, having a way to generate data consistent with your integration tests is
useful. Being able to create everything from scratch, including an instance of SQL Server running on a
container, is great for test environments.
131 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

EF Core InMemory database versus SQL Server running as a container
Another good choice when running tests is to use the Entity Framework InMemory database provider.
You can specify that configuration in the ConfigureServices method of the Startup class in your Web
API project:
public class Startup
{
// Other Startup code ...
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
services.AddSingleton<IConfiguration>(Configuration);
// DbContext using an InMemory database provider
services.AddDbContext<CatalogContext>(opt => opt.UseInMemoryDatabase());
//(Alternative: DbContext using a SQL Server provider
//services.AddDbContext<CatalogContext>(c =>
//{
// c.UseSqlServer(Configuration["ConnectionString"]);
//
//});
}
// Other Startup code ...
}
There is an important catch, though. The in-memory database does not support many constraints that
are specific to a particular database. For instance, you might add a unique index on a column in your
EF Core model and write a test against your in-memory database to check that it does not let you add
a duplicate value. But when you are using the in-memory database, you cannot handle unique indexes
on a column. Therefore, the in-memory database does not behave exactly the same as a real SQL
Server database—it does not emulate database-specific constraints.
Even so, an in-memory database is still useful for testing and prototyping. But if you want to create
accurate integration tests that take into account the behavior of a specific database implementation,
you need to use a real database like SQL Server. For that purpose, running SQL Server in a container is
a great choice and more accurate than the EF Core InMemory database provider.
Using a Redis cache service running in a container
You can run Redis on a container, especially for development and testing and for proof-of-concept
scenarios. This scenario is convenient, because you can have all your dependencies running on
containers—not just for your local development machines, but for your testing environments in your
CI/CD pipelines.
However, when you run Redis in production, it is better to look for a high-availability solution like
Redis Microsoft Azure, which runs as a PaaS (Platform as a Service). In your code, you just need to
change your connection strings.
Redis provides a Docker image with Redis. That image is available from Docker Hub at this URL:
https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/
132 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

You can directly run a Docker Redis container by executing the following Docker CLI command in your
command prompt:
docker run --name some-redis -d redis
The Redis image includes expose:6379 (the port used by Redis), so standard container linking will
make it automatically available to the linked containers.
In eShopOnContainers, the basket-api microservice uses a Redis cache running as a container. That
basketdata container is defined as part of the multi-container docker-compose.yml file, as shown in the
following example:
#docker-compose.yml file
#...
basketdata:
image: redis
expose:
- "6379"
This code in the docker-compose.yml defines a container named basketdata based on the redis image
and publishing the port 6379 internally. This configuration means that it will only be accessible from
other containers running within the Docker host.
Finally, in the docker-compose.override.yml file, the basket-api microservice for the
eShopOnContainers sample defines the connection string to use for that Redis container:
basket-api:
environment:
# Other data ...
- ConnectionString=basketdata
- EventBusConnection=rabbitmq
As mentioned before, the name of the microservice basketdata is resolved by Docker’s internal
network DNS.
Implementing event-based communication between
microservices (integration events)
As described earlier, when you use event-based communication, a microservice publishes an event
when something notable happens, such as when it updates a business entity. Other microservices
subscribe to those events. When a microservice receives an event, it can update its own business
entities, which might lead to more events being published. This is the essence of the eventual
consistency concept. This publish/subscribe system is usually performed by using an implementation
of an event bus. The event bus can be designed as an interface with the API needed to subscribe and
unsubscribe to events and to publish events. It can also have one or more implementations based on
any inter-process or messaging communication, such as a messaging queue or a service bus that
supports asynchronous communication and a publish/subscribe model.
You can use events to implement business transactions that span multiple services, which give you
eventual consistency between those services. An eventually consistent transaction consists of a series
133 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

of distributed actions. At each action, the microservice updates a business entity and publishes an
event that triggers the next action. Figure 6-18 below, shows a PriceUpdated event published through
an event bus, so the price update is propagated to the Basket and other microservices.
Figure 6-18. Event-driven communication based on an event bus
This section describes how you can implement this type of communication with .NET by using a
generic event bus interface, as shown in Figure 6-18. There are multiple potential implementations,
each using a different technology or infrastructure such as RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, or any other
third-party open-source or commercial service bus.
Using message brokers and service buses for production systems
As noted in the architecture section, you can choose from multiple messaging technologies for
implementing your abstract event bus. But these technologies are at different levels. For instance,
RabbitMQ, a messaging broker transport, is at a lower level than commercial products like Azure
Service Bus, NServiceBus, MassTransit, or Brighter. Most of these products can work on top of either
RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus. Your choice of product depends on how many features and how
much out-of-the-box scalability you need for your application.
For implementing just an event bus proof-of-concept for your development environment, as in the
eShopOnContainers sample, a simple implementation on top of RabbitMQ running as a container
might be enough. But for mission-critical and production systems that need high scalability, you
might want to evaluate and use Azure Service Bus.
If you require high-level abstractions and richer features like Sagas for long-running processes that
make distributed development easier, other commercial and open-source service buses like
NServiceBus, MassTransit, and Brighter are worth evaluating. In this case, the abstractions and API to
use would usually be directly the ones provided by those high-level service buses instead of your own
abstractions (like the simple event bus abstractions provided at eShopOnContainers). For that matter,
134 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


you can research the forked eShopOnContainers using NServiceBus (additional derived sample
implemented by Particular Software).
Of course, you could always build your own service bus features on top of lower-level technologies
like RabbitMQ and Docker, but the work needed to “reinvent the wheel” might be too costly for a
custom enterprise application.
To reiterate: the sample event bus abstractions and implementation showcased in the
eShopOnContainers sample are intended to be used only as a proof of concept. Once you have
decided that you want to have asynchronous and event-driven communication, as explained in the
current section, you should choose the service bus product that best fits your needs for production.
Integration events
Integration events are used for bringing domain state in sync across multiple microservices or external
systems. This functionality is done by publishing integration events outside the microservice. When an
event is published to multiple receiver microservices (to as many microservices as are subscribed to
the integration event), the appropriate event handler in each receiver microservice handles the event.
An integration event is basically a data-holding class, as in the following example:
public class ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent : IntegrationEvent
{
public int ProductId { get; private set; }
public decimal NewPrice { get; private set; }
public decimal OldPrice { get; private set; }
public ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent(int productId, decimal newPrice,
decimal oldPrice)
{
ProductId = productId;
NewPrice = newPrice;
OldPrice = oldPrice;
}
}
The integration events can be defined at the application level of each microservice, so they are
decoupled from other microservices, in a way comparable to how ViewModels are defined in the
server and client. What is not recommended is sharing a common integration events library across
multiple microservices; doing that would be coupling those microservices with a single event
definition data library. You do not want to do that for the same reasons that you do not want to share
a common domain model across multiple microservices: microservices must be completely
autonomous. For more information, see this blog post on the amount of data to put in events. Be
careful not to take this too far, as this other blog post describes the problem data deficient messages
can produce. Your design of your events should aim to be “just right” for the needs of their
consumers.
There are only a few kinds of libraries you should share across microservices. One is libraries that are
final application blocks, like the Event Bus client API, as in eShopOnContainers. Another is libraries
that constitute tools that could also be shared as NuGet components, like JSON serializers.
135 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


---

The event bus
An event bus allows publish/subscribe-style communication between microservices without requiring
the components to explicitly be aware of each other, as shown in Figure 6-19.
Figure 6-19. Publish/subscribe basics with an event bus
The above diagram shows that microservice A publishes to Event Bus, which distributes to subscribing
microservices B and C, without the publisher needing to know the subscribers. The event bus is
related to the Observer pattern and the publish-subscribe pattern.
Observer pattern
In the Observer pattern, your primary object (known as the Observable) notifies other interested
objects (known as Observers) with relevant information (events).
Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern
The purpose of the Publish/Subscribe pattern is the same as the Observer pattern: you want to notify
other services when certain events take place. But there is an important difference between the
Observer and Pub/Sub patterns. In the observer pattern, the broadcast is performed directly from the
observable to the observers, so they “know” each other. But when using a Pub/Sub pattern, there is a
third component, called broker, or message broker or event bus, which is known by both the
publisher and subscriber. Therefore, when using the Pub/Sub pattern the publisher and the
subscribers are precisely decoupled thanks to the mentioned event bus or message broker.
The middleman or event bus
How do you achieve anonymity between publisher and subscriber? An easy way is let a middleman
take care of all the communication. An event bus is one such middleman.
An event bus is typically composed of two parts:
• The abstraction or interface.
• One or more implementations.
136 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


In Figure 6-19 you can see how, from an application point of view, the event bus is nothing more than
a Pub/Sub channel. The way you implement this asynchronous communication can vary. It can have
multiple implementations so that you can swap between them, depending on the environment
requirements (for example, production versus development environments).
In Figure 6-20, you can see an abstraction of an event bus with multiple implementations based on
infrastructure messaging technologies like RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, or another event/message
broker.
Figure 6- 20. Multiple implementations of an event bus
It’s good to have the event bus defined through an interface so it can be implemented with several
technologies, like RabbitMQ, Azure Service bus or others. However, and as mentioned previously,
using your own abstractions (the event bus interface) is good only if you need basic event bus
features supported by your abstractions. If you need richer service bus features, you should probably
use the API and abstractions provided by your preferred commercial service bus instead of your own
abstractions.
Defining an event bus interface
Let’s start with some implementation code for the event bus interface and possible implementations
for exploration purposes. The interface should be generic and straightforward, as in the following
interface.
public interface IEventBus
{
void Publish(IntegrationEvent @event);
void Subscribe<T, TH>()
where T : IntegrationEvent
where TH : IIntegrationEventHandler<T>;
void SubscribeDynamic<TH>(string eventName)
where TH : IDynamicIntegrationEventHandler;
137 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


void UnsubscribeDynamic<TH>(string eventName)
where TH : IDynamicIntegrationEventHandler;
void Unsubscribe<T, TH>()
where TH : IIntegrationEventHandler<T>
where T : IntegrationEvent;
}
The Publish method is straightforward. The event bus will broadcast the integration event passed to it
to any microservice, or even an external application, subscribed to that event. This method is used by
the microservice that is publishing the event.
The Subscribe methods (you can have several implementations depending on the arguments) are
used by the microservices that want to receive events. This method has two arguments. The first is the
integration event to subscribe to (IntegrationEvent). The second argument is the integration event
handler (or callback method), named IIntegrationEventHandler<T>, to be executed when the receiver
microservice gets that integration event message.

Implementing an event bus with RabbitMQ for the
development or test environment
We should start by saying that if you create your custom event bus based on RabbitMQ running in a
container, as the eShopOnContainers application does, it should be used only for your development
and test environments. Don’t use it for your production environment, unless you are building it as a
part of a production-ready service bus as described in the Additional resources section below. A
simple custom event bus might be missing many production-ready critical features that a commercial
service bus has.
One of the event bus custom implementations in eShopOnContainers is basically a library using the
RabbitMQ API. (There’s another implementation based on Azure Service Bus.)
The event bus implementation with RabbitMQ lets microservices subscribe to events, publish events,
and receive events, as shown in Figure 6-21.
138 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Figure 6-21. RabbitMQ implementation of an event bus
RabbitMQ functions as an intermediary between message publisher and subscribers, to handle
distribution. In the code, the EventBusRabbitMQ class implements the generic IEventBus interface.
This implementation is based on Dependency Injection so that you can swap from this dev/test
version to a production version.
public class EventBusRabbitMQ : IEventBus, IDisposable
{
// Implementation using RabbitMQ API
//...
}
The RabbitMQ implementation of a sample dev/test event bus is boilerplate code. It has to handle the
connection to the RabbitMQ server and provide code for publishing a message event to the queues. It
also has to implement a dictionary of collections of integration event handlers for each event type;
these event types can have a different instantiation and different subscriptions for each receiver
microservice, as shown in Figure 6-21.
Implementing a simple publish method with RabbitMQ
The following code is a simplified version of an event bus implementation for RabbitMQ, to
showcase the whole scenario. You don’t really handle the connection this way. To see the full
implementation, see the actual code in the dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers repository.
public class EventBusRabbitMQ : IEventBus, IDisposable
{
// Member objects and other methods ...
// ...
public void Publish(IntegrationEvent @event)
{
var eventName = @event.GetType().Name;
var factory = new ConnectionFactory() { HostName = _connectionString };
using (var connection = factory.CreateConnection())
using (var channel = connection.CreateModel())
139 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


{
channel.ExchangeDeclare(exchange: _brokerName,
type: "direct");
string message = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(@event);
var body = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message);
channel.BasicPublish(exchange: _brokerName,
routingKey: eventName,
basicProperties: null,
body: body);
}
}
}
The actual code of the Publish method in the eShopOnContainers application is improved by using a
Polly retry policy, which retries the task some times in case the RabbitMQ container is not ready. This
scenario can occur when docker-compose is starting the containers; for example, the RabbitMQ
container might start more slowly than the other containers.
As mentioned earlier, there are many possible configurations in RabbitMQ, so this code should be
used only for dev/test environments.
Implementing the subscription code with the RabbitMQ API
As with the publish code, the following code is a simplification of part of the event bus
implementation for RabbitMQ. Again, you usually do not need to change it unless you are improving
it.
public class EventBusRabbitMQ : IEventBus, IDisposable
{
// Member objects and other methods ...
// ...
public void Subscribe<T, TH>()
where T : IntegrationEvent
where TH : IIntegrationEventHandler<T>
{
var eventName = _subsManager.GetEventKey<T>();
var containsKey = _subsManager.HasSubscriptionsForEvent(eventName);
if (!containsKey)
{
if (!_persistentConnection.IsConnected)
{
_persistentConnection.TryConnect();
}
using (var channel = _persistentConnection.CreateModel())
{
channel.QueueBind(queue: _queueName,
exchange: BROKER_NAME,
routingKey: eventName);
}
}
_subsManager.AddSubscription<T, TH>();
}
}
140 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Each event type has a related channel to get events from RabbitMQ. You can then have as many event
handlers per channel and event type as needed.
The Subscribe method accepts an IIntegrationEventHandler object, which is like a callback method in
the current microservice, plus its related IntegrationEvent object. The code then adds that event
handler to the list of event handlers that each integration event type can have per client microservice.
If the client code has not already been subscribed to the event, the code creates a channel for the
event type so it can receive events in a push style from RabbitMQ when that event is published from
any other service.
As mentioned above, the event bus implemented in eShopOnContainers has only an educational
purpose, since it only handles the main scenarios, so it’s not ready for production.
For production scenarios check the additional resources below, specific for RabbitMQ, and the
Implementing event-based communication between microservices section.

Subscribing to events
The first step for using the event bus is to subscribe the microservices to the events they want to
receive. That functionality should be done in the receiver microservices.
The following simple code shows what each receiver microservice needs to implement when starting
the service (that is, in the Startup class) so it subscribes to the events it needs. In this case, the basket-
api microservice needs to subscribe to ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent and the
OrderStartedIntegrationEvent messages.
For instance, when subscribing to the ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent event, that makes the
basket microservice aware of any changes to the product price and lets it warn the user about the
change if that product is in the user’s basket.
var eventBus = app.ApplicationServices.GetRequiredService<IEventBus>();
eventBus.Subscribe<ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent,
141 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEventHandler>();
eventBus.Subscribe<OrderStartedIntegrationEvent,
OrderStartedIntegrationEventHandler>();
After this code runs, the subscriber microservice will be listening through RabbitMQ channels. When
any message of type ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent arrives, the code invokes the event
handler that is passed to it and processes the event.
Publishing events through the event bus
Finally, the message sender (origin microservice) publishes the integration events with code similar to
the following example. (This approach is a simplified example that does not take atomicity into
account.) You would implement similar code whenever an event must be propagated across multiple
microservices, usually right after committing data or transactions from the origin microservice.
First, the event bus implementation object (based on RabbitMQ or based on a service bus) would be
injected at the controller constructor, as in the following code:
[Route("api/v1/[controller]")]
public class CatalogController : ControllerBase
{
private readonly CatalogContext _context;
private readonly IOptionsSnapshot<Settings> _settings;
private readonly IEventBus _eventBus;
public CatalogController(CatalogContext context,
IOptionsSnapshot<Settings> settings,
IEventBus eventBus)
{
_context = context;
_settings = settings;
_eventBus = eventBus;
}
// ...
}
Then you use it from your controller’s methods, like in the UpdateProduct method:
[Route("items")]
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateProduct([FromBody]CatalogItem product)
{
var item = await _context.CatalogItems.SingleOrDefaultAsync(
i => i.Id == product.Id);
// ...
if (item.Price != product.Price)
{
var oldPrice = item.Price;
item.Price = product.Price;
_context.CatalogItems.Update(item);
var @event = new ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent(item.Id,
item.Price,
oldPrice);
// Commit changes in original transaction
await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
// Publish integration event to the event bus
// (RabbitMQ or a service bus underneath)
142 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

_eventBus.Publish(@event);
// ...
}
// ...
}
In this case, since the origin microservice is a simple CRUD microservice, that code is placed right into
a Web API controller.
In more advanced microservices, like when using CQRS approaches, it can be implemented in the
CommandHandler class, within the Handle() method.
Designing atomicity and resiliency when publishing to the event bus
When you publish integration events through a distributed messaging system like your event bus, you
have the problem of atomically updating the original database and publishing an event (that is, either
both operations complete or none of them). For instance, in the simplified example shown earlier, the
code commits data to the database when the product price is changed and then publishes a
ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent message. Initially, it might look essential that these two
operations be performed atomically. However, if you are using a distributed transaction involving the
database and the message broker, as you do in older systems like Microsoft Message Queuing
(MSMQ), this approach is not recommended for the reasons described by the CAP theorem.
Basically, you use microservices to build scalable and highly available systems. Simplifying somewhat,
the CAP theorem says that you cannot build a (distributed) database (or a microservice that owns its
model) that’s continually available, strongly consistent, and tolerant to any partition. You must choose
two of these three properties.
In microservices-based architectures, you should choose availability and tolerance, and you should
de-emphasize strong consistency. Therefore, in most modern microservice-based applications, you
usually do not want to use distributed transactions in messaging, as you do when you implement
distributed transactions based on the Windows Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) with
MSMQ.
Let’s go back to the initial issue and its example. If the service crashes after the database is updated
(in this case, right after the line of code with _context.SaveChangesAsync()), but before the integration
event is published, the overall system could become inconsistent. This approach might be business
critical, depending on the specific business operation you are dealing with.
As mentioned earlier in the architecture section, you can have several approaches for dealing with this
issue:
• Using the full Event Sourcing pattern.
• Using transaction log mining.
• Using the Outbox pattern. This is a transactional table to store the integration events
(extending the local transaction).
For this scenario, using the full Event Sourcing (ES) pattern is one of the best approaches, if not the
best. However, in many application scenarios, you might not be able to implement a full ES system. ES
means storing only domain events in your transactional database, instead of storing current state
143 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

data. Storing only domain events can have great benefits, such as having the history of your system
available and being able to determine the state of your system at any moment in the past. However,
implementing a full ES system requires you to rearchitect most of your system and introduces many
other complexities and requirements. For example, you would want to use a database specifically
made for event sourcing, such as Event Store, or a document-oriented database such as Azure
Cosmos DB, MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, or RavenDB. ES is a great approach for this problem, but
not the easiest solution unless you are already familiar with event sourcing.
The option to use transaction log mining initially looks transparent. However, to use this approach,
the microservice has to be coupled to your RDBMS transaction log, such as the SQL Server transaction
log. This approach is probably not desirable. Another drawback is that the low-level updates recorded
in the transaction log might not be at the same level as your high-level integration events. If so, the
process of reverse-engineering those transaction log operations can be difficult.
A balanced approach is a mix of a transactional database table and a simplified ES pattern. You can
use a state such as “ready to publish the event,” which you set in the original event when you commit
it to the integration events table. You then try to publish the event to the event bus. If the publish-
event action succeeds, you start another transaction in the origin service and move the state from
“ready to publish the event” to “event already published.”
If the publish-event action in the event bus fails, the data still will not be inconsistent within the origin
microservice—it is still marked as “ready to publish the event,” and with respect to the rest of the
services, it will eventually be consistent. You can always have background jobs checking the state of
the transactions or integration events. If the job finds an event in the “ready to publish the event”
state, it can try to republish that event to the event bus.
Notice that with this approach, you are persisting only the integration events for each origin
microservice, and only the events that you want to communicate to other microservices or external
systems. In contrast, in a full ES system, you store all domain events as well.
Therefore, this balanced approach is a simplified ES system. You need a list of integration events with
their current state (“ready to publish” versus “published”). But you only need to implement these
states for the integration events. And in this approach, you do not need to store all your domain data
as events in the transactional database, as you would in a full ES system.
If you are already using a relational database, you can use a transactional table to store integration
events. To achieve atomicity in your application, you use a two-step process based on local
transactions. Basically, you have an IntegrationEvent table in the same database where you have your
domain entities. That table works as an insurance for achieving atomicity so that you include persisted
integration events into the same transactions that are committing your domain data.
Step by step, the process goes like this:
1. The application begins a local database transaction.
2. It then updates the state of your domain entities and inserts an event into the integration
event table.
3. Finally, it commits the transaction, so you get the desired atomicity and then
144 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

4. You publish the event somehow (next).
When implementing the steps of publishing the events, you have these choices:
• Publish the integration event right after committing the transaction and use another local
transaction to mark the events in the table as being published. Then, use the table just as an
artifact to track the integration events in case of issues in the remote microservices, and
perform compensatory actions based on the stored integration events.
• Use the table as a kind of queue. A separate application thread or process queries the
integration event table, publishes the events to the event bus, and then uses a local
transaction to mark the events as published.
Figure 6-22 shows the architecture for the first of these approaches.
Figure 6-22. Atomicity when publishing events to the event bus
The approach illustrated in Figure 6-22 is missing an additional worker microservice that is in charge
of checking and confirming the success of the published integration events. In case of failure, that
additional checker worker microservice can read events from the table and republish them, that is,
repeat step number 2.
About the second approach: you use the EventLog table as a queue and always use a worker
microservice to publish the messages. In that case, the process is like that shown in Figure 6-23. This
shows an additional microservice, and the table is the single source when publishing events.
145 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications



---

Figure 6-23. Atomicity when publishing events to the event bus with a worker microservice
For simplicity, the eShopOnContainers sample uses the first approach (with no additional processes or
checker microservices) plus the event bus. However, the eShopOnContainers sample is not handling
all possible failure cases. In a real application deployed to the cloud, you must embrace the fact that
issues will arise eventually, and you must implement that check and resend logic. Using the table as a
queue can be more effective than the first approach if you have that table as a single source of events
when publishing them (with the worker) through the event bus.
Implementing atomicity when publishing integration events through the event
bus
The following code shows how you can create a single transaction involving multiple DbContext
objects—one context related to the original data being updated, and the second context related to
the IntegrationEventLog table.
The transaction in the example code below will not be resilient if connections to the database have
any issue at the time when the code is running. This can happen in cloud-based systems like Azure
SQL DB, which might move databases across servers. For implementing resilient transactions across
multiple contexts, see the Implementing resilient Entity Framework Core SQL connections section later
in this guide.
For clarity, the following example shows the whole process in a single piece of code. However, the
eShopOnContainers implementation is refactored and splits this logic into multiple classes so it’s
easier to maintain.
// Update Product from the Catalog microservice
//
public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateProduct([FromBody]CatalogItem productToUpdate)
{
var catalogItem =
await _catalogContext.CatalogItems.SingleOrDefaultAsync(i => i.Id ==
productToUpdate.Id);
146 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


if (catalogItem == null) return NotFound();
bool raiseProductPriceChangedEvent = false;
IntegrationEvent priceChangedEvent = null;
if (catalogItem.Price != productToUpdate.Price)
raiseProductPriceChangedEvent = true;
if (raiseProductPriceChangedEvent) // Create event if price has changed
{
var oldPrice = catalogItem.Price;
priceChangedEvent = new ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent(catalogItem.Id,
productToUpdate.Price,
oldPrice);
}
// Update current product
catalogItem = productToUpdate;
// Just save the updated product if the Product's Price hasn't changed.
if (!raiseProductPriceChangedEvent)
{
await _catalogContext.SaveChangesAsync();
}
else // Publish to event bus only if product price changed
{
// Achieving atomicity between original DB and the IntegrationEventLog
// with a local transaction
using (var transaction = _catalogContext.Database.BeginTransaction())
{
_catalogContext.CatalogItems.Update(catalogItem);
await _catalogContext.SaveChangesAsync();
await _integrationEventLogService.SaveEventAsync(priceChangedEvent);
transaction.Commit();
}
// Publish the integration event through the event bus
_eventBus.Publish(priceChangedEvent);
_integrationEventLogService.MarkEventAsPublishedAsync(
priceChangedEvent);
}
return Ok();
}
After the ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent integration event is created, the transaction that
stores the original domain operation (update the catalog item) also includes the persistence of the
event in the EventLog table. This makes it a single transaction, and you will always be able to check
whether event messages were sent.
The event log table is updated atomically with the original database operation, using a local
transaction against the same database. If any of the operations fail, an exception is thrown and the
transaction rolls back any completed operation, thus maintaining consistency between the domain
operations and the event messages saved to the table.
147 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Receiving messages from subscriptions: event handlers in receiver microservices
In addition to the event subscription logic, you need to implement the internal code for the
integration event handlers (like a callback method). The event handler is where you specify where the
event messages of a certain type will be received and processed.
An event handler first receives an event instance from the event bus. Then it locates the component to
be processed related to that integration event, propagating and persisting the event as a change in
state in the receiver microservice. For example, if a ProductPriceChanged event originates in the
catalog microservice, it is handled in the basket microservice and changes the state in this receiver
basket microservice as well, as shown in the following code.
namespace Microsoft.eShopOnContainers.Services.Basket.API.IntegrationEvents.EventHandling
{
public class ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEventHandler :
IIntegrationEventHandler<ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent>
{
private readonly IBasketRepository _repository;
public ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEventHandler(
IBasketRepository repository)
{
_repository = repository;
}
public async Task Handle(ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent @event)
{
var userIds = await _repository.GetUsers();
foreach (var id in userIds)
{
var basket = await _repository.GetBasket(id);
await UpdatePriceInBasketItems(@event.ProductId, @event.NewPrice, basket);
}
}
private async Task UpdatePriceInBasketItems(int productId, decimal newPrice,
CustomerBasket basket)
{
var itemsToUpdate = basket?.Items?.Where(x => int.Parse(x.ProductId) ==
productId).ToList();
if (itemsToUpdate != null)
{
foreach (var item in itemsToUpdate)
{
if(item.UnitPrice != newPrice)
{
var originalPrice = item.UnitPrice;
item.UnitPrice = newPrice;
item.OldUnitPrice = originalPrice;
}
}
await _repository.UpdateBasket(basket);
}
}
}
}
148 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

The event handler needs to verify whether the product exists in any of the basket instances. It also
updates the item price for each related basket line item. Finally, it creates an alert to be displayed to
the user about the price change, as shown in Figure 6-24.
Figure 6-24. Displaying an item price change in a basket, as communicated by integration events
Idempotency in update message events
An important aspect of update message events is that a failure at any point in the communication
should cause the message to be retried. Otherwise a background task might try to publish an event
that has already been published, creating a race condition. Make sure that the updates are either
idempotent or that they provide enough information to ensure that you can detect a duplicate,
discard it, and send back only one response.
As noted earlier, idempotency means that an operation can be performed multiple times without
changing the result. In a messaging environment, as when communicating events, an event is
idempotent if it can be delivered multiple times without changing the result for the receiver
microservice. This may be necessary because of the nature of the event itself, or because of the way
the system handles the event. Message idempotency is important in any application that uses
messaging, not just in applications that implement the event bus pattern.
An example of an idempotent operation is a SQL statement that inserts data into a table only if that
data is not already in the table. It does not matter how many times you run that insert SQL statement;
the result will be the same—the table will contain that data. Idempotency like this can also be
necessary when dealing with messages if the messages could potentially be sent and therefore
149 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


processed more than once. For instance, if retry logic causes a sender to send exactly the same
message more than once, you need to make sure that it is idempotent.
It is possible to design idempotent messages. For example, you can create an event that says “set the
product price to $25” instead of “add $5 to the product price.” You could safely process the first
message any number of times and the result will be the same. That is not true for the second
message. But even in the first case, you might not want to process the first event, because the system
could also have sent a newer price-change event and you would be overwriting the new price.
Another example might be an order-completed event that’s propagated to multiple subscribers. The
app has to make sure that order information is updated in other systems only once, even if there are
duplicated message events for the same order-completed event.
It is convenient to have some kind of identity per event so that you can create logic that enforces that
each event is processed only once per receiver.
Some message processing is inherently idempotent. For example, if a system generates image
thumbnails, it might not matter how many times the message about the generated thumbnail is
processed; the outcome is that the thumbnails are generated and they are the same every time. On
the other hand, operations such as calling a payment gateway to charge a credit card may not be
idempotent at all. In these cases, you need to ensure that processing a message multiple times has
the effect that you expect.

Deduplicating integration event messages
You can make sure that message events are sent and processed only once per subscriber at different
levels. One way is to use a deduplication feature offered by the messaging infrastructure you are
using. Another is to implement custom logic in your destination microservice. Having validations at
both the transport level and the application level is your best bet.
Deduplicating message events at the EventHandler level
One way to make sure that an event is processed only once by any receiver is by implementing certain
logic when processing the message events in event handlers. For example, that is the approach used
in the eShopOnContainers application, as you can see in the source code of the
UserCheckoutAcceptedIntegrationEventHandler class when it receives a
UserCheckoutAcceptedIntegrationEvent integration event. (In this case, the CreateOrderCommand is
wrapped with an IdentifiedCommand, using the eventMsg.RequestId as an identifier, before sending it
to the command handler).
150 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Deduplicating messages when using RabbitMQ
When intermittent network failures happen, messages can be duplicated, and the message receiver
must be ready to handle these duplicated messages. If possible, receivers should handle messages in
an idempotent way, which is better than explicitly handling them with deduplication.
According to the RabbitMQ documentation, “If a message is delivered to a consumer and then
requeued (because it was not acknowledged before the consumer connection dropped, for example)
then RabbitMQ will set the redelivered flag on it when it is delivered again (whether to the same
consumer or a different one).
If the “redelivered” flag is set, the receiver must take that into account, because the message might
already have been processed. But that is not guaranteed; the message might never have reached the
receiver after it left the message broker, perhaps because of network issues. On the other hand, if the
“redelivered” flag is not set, it is guaranteed that the message has not been sent more than once.
Therefore, the receiver needs to deduplicate messages or process messages in an idempotent way
only if the “redelivered” flag is set in the message.

Testing ASP.NET Core services and web apps
Controllers are a central part of any ASP.NET Core API service and ASP.NET MVC Web application. As
such, you should have confidence they behave as intended for your application. Automated tests can
provide you with this confidence and can detect errors before they reach production.
You need to test how the controller behaves based on valid or invalid inputs, and test controller
responses based on the result of the business operation it performs. However, you should have these
types of tests for your microservices:
• Unit tests. These tests ensure that individual components of the application work as expected.
Assertions test the component API.
• Integration tests. These tests ensure that component interactions work as expected against
external artifacts like databases. Assertions can test component API, UI, or the side effects of
actions like database I/O, logging, etc.
152 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

• Functional tests for each microservice. These tests ensure that the application works as
expected from the user’s perspective.
• Service tests. These tests ensure that end-to-end service use cases, including testing multiple
services at the same time, are tested. For this type of testing, you need to prepare the
environment first. In this case, it means starting the services (for example, by using docker-
compose up).
Implementing unit tests for ASP.NET Core Web APIs
Unit testing involves testing a part of an application in isolation from its infrastructure and
dependencies. When you unit test controller logic, only the content of a single action or method is
tested, not the behavior of its dependencies or of the framework itself. Unit tests do not detect issues
in the interaction between components—that is the purpose of integration testing.
As you unit test your controller actions, make sure you focus only on their behavior. A controller unit
test avoids things like filters, routing, or model binding (the mapping of request data to a ViewModel
or DTO). Because they focus on testing just one thing, unit tests are generally simple to write and
quick to run. A well-written set of unit tests can be run frequently without much overhead.
Unit tests are implemented based on test frameworks like xUnit.net, MSTest, Moq, or NUnit. For the
eShopOnContainers sample application, we are using xUnit.
When you write a unit test for a Web API controller, you instantiate the controller class directly using
the new keyword in C#, so that the test will run as fast as possible. The following example shows how
to do this when using xUnit as the Test framework.
[Fact]
public async Task Get_order_detail_success()
{
//Arrange
var fakeOrderId = "12";
var fakeOrder = GetFakeOrder();
//...
//Act
var orderController = new OrderController(
_orderServiceMock.Object,
_basketServiceMock.Object,
_identityParserMock.Object);
orderController.ControllerContext.HttpContext = _contextMock.Object;
var actionResult = await orderController.Detail(fakeOrderId);
//Assert
var viewResult = Assert.IsType<ViewResult>(actionResult);
Assert.IsAssignableFrom<Order>(viewResult.ViewData.Model);
}
153 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Implementing integration and functional tests for each microservice
As noted, integration tests and functional tests have different purposes and goals. However, the way
you implement both when testing ASP.NET Core controllers is similar, so in this section we
concentrate on integration tests.
Integration testing ensures that an application’s components function correctly when assembled.
ASP.NET Core supports integration testing using unit test frameworks and a built-in test web host that
can be used to handle requests without network overhead.
Unlike unit testing, integration tests frequently involve application infrastructure concerns, such as a
database, file system, network resources, or web requests and responses. Unit tests use fakes or mock
objects in place of these concerns. But the purpose of integration tests is to confirm that the system
works as expected with these systems, so for integration testing you do not use fakes or mock objects.
Instead, you include the infrastructure, like database access or service invocation from other services.
Because integration tests exercise larger segments of code than unit tests, and because integration
tests rely on infrastructure elements, they tend to be orders of magnitude slower than unit tests. Thus,
it is a good idea to limit how many integration tests you write and run.
ASP.NET Core includes a built-in test web host that can be used to handle HTTP requests without
network overhead, meaning that you can run those tests faster than when using a real web host. The
test web host (TestServer) is available in a NuGet component as Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost. It can
be added to integration test projects and used to host ASP.NET Core applications.
As you can see in the following code, when you create integration tests for ASP.NET Core controllers,
you instantiate the controllers through the test host. This functionality is comparable to an HTTP
request, but it runs faster.
public class PrimeWebDefaultRequestShould
{
private readonly TestServer _server;
private readonly HttpClient _client;
public PrimeWebDefaultRequestShould()
{
// Arrange
_server = new TestServer(new WebHostBuilder()
.UseStartup<Startup>());
_client = _server.CreateClient();
}
[Fact]
public async Task ReturnHelloWorld()
{
// Act
var response = await _client.GetAsync("/");
response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
var responseString = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
// Assert
Assert.Equal("Hello World!", responseString);
}
}

Implementing service tests on a multi-container application
As noted earlier, when you test multi-container applications, all the microservices need to be running
within the Docker host or container cluster. End-to-end service tests that include multiple operations
involving several microservices require you to deploy and start the whole application in the Docker
host by running docker-compose up (or a comparable mechanism if you are using an orchestrator).
Once the whole application and all its services is running, you can execute end-to-end integration and
functional tests.
There are a few approaches you can use. In the docker-compose.yml file that you use to deploy the
application at the solution level you can expand the entry point to use dotnet test. You can also use
another compose file that would run your tests in the image you are targeting. By using another
compose file for integration tests that includes your microservices and databases on containers, you
can make sure that the related data is always reset to its original state before running the tests.
Once the compose application is up and running, you can take advantage of breakpoints and
exceptions if you are running Visual Studio. Or you can run the integration tests automatically in your
CI pipeline in Azure DevOps Services or any other CI/CD system that supports Docker containers.
Testing in eShopOnContainers
The reference application (eShopOnContainers) tests were recently restructured and now there are
four categories:
1. Unit tests, just plain old regular unit tests, contained in the {MicroserviceName}.UnitTests
projects
155 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


---

2. Microservice functional/integration tests, with test cases involving the infrastructure for
each microservice but isolated from the others and are contained in the
{MicroserviceName}.FunctionalTests projects.
3. Application functional/integration tests, which focus on microservices integration, with test
cases that exert several microservices. These tests are located in project
Application.FunctionalTests.
While unit and integration tests are organized in a test folder within the microservice project,
application and load tests are managed separately under the root folder, as shown in Figure 6-25.
Figure 6-25. Test folder structure in eShopOnContainers
Microservice and Application functional/integration tests are run from Visual Studio, using the regular
tests runner, but first you need to start the required infrastructure services, with a set of docker-
compose files contained in the solution test folder:
docker-compose-test.yml
version: '3.4'
services:
redis.data:
image: redis:alpine
rabbitmq:
image: rabbitmq:3-management-alpine
sqldata:
156 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
nosqldata:
image: mongo
docker-compose-test.override.yml
version: '3.4'
services:
redis.data:
ports:
- "6379:6379"
rabbitmq:
ports:
- "15672:15672"
- "5672:5672"
sqldata:
environment:
- SA_PASSWORD=Pass@word
- ACCEPT_EULA=Y
ports:
- "5433:1433"
nosqldata:
ports:
- "27017:27017"
So, to run the functional/integration tests you must first run this command, from the solution test
folder:
docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml -f docker-compose-test.override.yml up
As you can see, these docker-compose files only start the Redis, RabbitMQ, SQL Server, and MongoDB
microservices.

Implement background tasks in microservices with
IHostedService and the BackgroundService class
Background tasks and scheduled jobs are something you might need to use in any application,
whether or not it follows the microservices architecture pattern. The difference when using a
microservices architecture is that you can implement the background task in a separate
process/container for hosting so you can scale it down/up based on your need.
157 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

From a generic point of view, in .NET we called these type of tasks Hosted Services, because they are
services/logic that you host within your host/application/microservice. Note that in this case, the
hosted service simply means a class with the background task logic.
Since .NET Core 2.0, the framework provides a new interface named IHostedService helping you to
easily implement hosted services. The basic idea is that you can register multiple background tasks
(hosted services) that run in the background while your web host or host is running, as shown in the
image 6-26.
Figure 6-26. Using IHostedService in a WebHost vs. a Host
ASP.NET Core 1.x and 2.x support IWebHost for background processes in web apps. .NET Core 2.1 and
later versions support IHost for background processes with plain console apps. Note the difference
made between WebHost and Host.
A WebHost (base class implementing IWebHost) in ASP.NET Core 2.0 is the infrastructure artifact you
use to provide HTTP server features to your process, such as when you’re implementing an MVC web
app or Web API service. It provides all the new infrastructure goodness in ASP.NET Core, enabling you
to use dependency injection, insert middlewares in the request pipeline, and similar. The WebHost
uses these very same IHostedServices for background tasks.
A Host (base class implementing IHost) was introduced in .NET Core 2.1. Basically, a Host allows you
to have a similar infrastructure than what you have with WebHost (dependency injection, hosted
services, etc.), but in this case, you just want to have a simple and lighter process as the host, with
nothing related to MVC, Web API or HTTP server features.
Therefore, you can choose and either create a specialized host-process with IHost to handle the
hosted services and nothing else, such a microservice made just for hosting the IHostedServices, or
you can alternatively extend an existing ASP.NET Core WebHost, such as an existing ASP.NET Core
Web API or MVC app.
158 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


Each approach has pros and cons depending on your business and scalability needs. The bottom line
is basically that if your background tasks have nothing to do with HTTP (IWebHost) you should use
IHost.
Registering hosted services in your WebHost or Host
Let’s drill down further on the IHostedService interface since its usage is pretty similar in a WebHost or
in a Host.
SignalR is one example of an artifact using hosted services, but you can also use it for much simpler
things like:
• A background task polling a database looking for changes.
• A scheduled task updating some cache periodically.
• An implementation of QueueBackgroundWorkItem that allows a task to be executed on a
background thread.
• Processing messages from a message queue in the background of a web app while sharing
common services such as ILogger.
• A background task started with Task.Run().
You can basically offload any of those actions to a background task that implements IHostedService.
The way you add one or multiple IHostedServices into your WebHost or Host is by registering them
up through the AddHostedService extension method in an ASP.NET Core WebHost (or in a Host in
.NET Core 2.1 and above). Basically, you have to register the hosted services within application startup
in Program.cs.
//Other DI registrations;
// Register Hosted Services
builder.Services.AddHostedService<GracePeriodManagerService>();
builder.Services.AddHostedService<MyHostedServiceB>();
builder.Services.AddHostedService<MyHostedServiceC>();
//...
In that code, the GracePeriodManagerService hosted service is real code from the Ordering business
microservice in eShopOnContainers, while the other two are just two additional samples.
The IHostedService background task execution is coordinated with the lifetime of the application (host
or microservice, for that matter). You register tasks when the application starts and you have the
opportunity to do some graceful action or clean-up when the application is shutting down.
Without using IHostedService, you could always start a background thread to run any task. The
difference is precisely at the app’s shutdown time when that thread would simply be killed without
having the opportunity to run graceful clean-up actions.
The IHostedService interface
When you register an IHostedService, .NET calls the StartAsync() and StopAsync() methods of your
IHostedService type during application start and stop respectively. For more details, see
IHostedService interface.
159 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

As you can imagine, you can create multiple implementations of IHostedService and register each of
them in Program.cs, as shown previously. All those hosted services will be started and stopped along
with the application/microservice.
As a developer, you are responsible for handling the stopping action of your services when
StopAsync() method is triggered by the host.
Implementing IHostedService with a custom hosted service class
deriving from the BackgroundService base class
You could go ahead and create your custom hosted service class from scratch and implement the
IHostedService, as you need to do when using .NET Core 2.0 and later.
However, since most background tasks will have similar needs in regard to the cancellation tokens
management and other typical operations, there is a convenient abstract base class you can derive
from, named BackgroundService (available since .NET Core 2.1).
That class provides the main work needed to set up the background task.
The next code is the abstract BackgroundService base class as implemented in .NET.
// Copyright (c) .NET Foundation. Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
/// <summary>
/// Base class for implementing a long running <see cref="IHostedService"/>.
/// </summary>
public abstract class BackgroundService : IHostedService, IDisposable
{
private Task _executingTask;
private readonly CancellationTokenSource _stoppingCts =
new CancellationTokenSource();
protected abstract Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken);
public virtual Task StartAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
// Store the task we're executing
_executingTask = ExecuteAsync(_stoppingCts.Token);
// If the task is completed then return it,
// this will bubble cancellation and failure to the caller
if (_executingTask.IsCompleted)
{
return _executingTask;
}
// Otherwise it's running
return Task.CompletedTask;
}
public virtual async Task StopAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
// Stop called without start
if (_executingTask == null)
{
return;
}
160 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

try
{
// Signal cancellation to the executing method
_stoppingCts.Cancel();
}
finally
{
// Wait until the task completes or the stop token triggers
await Task.WhenAny(_executingTask, Task.Delay(Timeout.Infinite,
cancellationToken));
}
}
public virtual void Dispose()
{
_stoppingCts.Cancel();
}
}
When deriving from the previous abstract base class, thanks to that inherited implementation, you just
need to implement the ExecuteAsync() method in your own custom hosted service class, as in the
following simplified code from eShopOnContainers which is polling a database and publishing
integration events into the Event Bus when needed.
public class GracePeriodManagerService : BackgroundService
{
private readonly ILogger<GracePeriodManagerService> _logger;
private readonly OrderingBackgroundSettings _settings;
private readonly IEventBus _eventBus;
public GracePeriodManagerService(IOptions<OrderingBackgroundSettings> settings,
IEventBus eventBus,
ILogger<GracePeriodManagerService> logger)
{
// Constructor's parameters validations...
}
protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
{
_logger.LogDebug($"GracePeriodManagerService is starting.");
stoppingToken.Register(() =>
_logger.LogDebug($" GracePeriod background task is stopping."));
while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
{
_logger.LogDebug($"GracePeriod task doing background work.");
// This eShopOnContainers method is querying a database table
// and publishing events into the Event Bus (RabbitMQ / ServiceBus)
CheckConfirmedGracePeriodOrders();
try {
await Task.Delay(_settings.CheckUpdateTime, stoppingToken);
}
catch (TaskCanceledException exception) {
_logger.LogCritical(exception, "TaskCanceledException Error",
exception.Message);
161 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

}
}
_logger.LogDebug($"GracePeriod background task is stopping.");
}
.../...
}
In this specific case for eShopOnContainers, it’s executing an application method that’s querying a
database table looking for orders with a specific state and when applying changes, it is publishing
integration events through the event bus (underneath it can be using RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus).
Of course, you could run any other business background task, instead.
By default, the cancellation token is set with a 5 seconds timeout, although you can change that value
when building your WebHost using the UseShutdownTimeout extension of the IWebHostBuilder. This
means that our service is expected to cancel within 5 seconds otherwise it will be more abruptly killed.
The following code would be changing that time to 10 seconds.
WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
.UseShutdownTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10))
...

The following image shows a visual summary of the classes and interfaces involved when
implementing IHostedServices.

162 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


Deployment considerations and takeaways
It is important to note that the way you deploy your ASP.NET Core WebHost or .NET Host might
impact the final solution. For instance, if you deploy your WebHost on IIS or a regular Azure App
Service, your host can be shut down because of app pool recycles. But if you are deploying your host
as a container into an orchestrator like Kubernetes, you can control the assured number of live
instances of your host. In addition, you could consider other approaches in the cloud especially made
for these scenarios, like Azure Functions. Finally, if you need the service to be running all the time and
are deploying on a Windows Server you could use a Windows Service.
But even for a WebHost deployed into an app pool, there are scenarios like repopulating or flushing
application’s in-memory cache that would be still applicable.
The IHostedService interface provides a convenient way to start background tasks in an ASP.NET Core
web application (in .NET Core 2.0 and later versions) or in any process/host (starting in .NET Core 2.1
with IHost). Its main benefit is the opportunity you get with the graceful cancellation to clean-up the
code of your background tasks when the host itself is shutting down.

Implement API Gateways with Ocelot
Important
The reference microservice application eShopOnContainers is currently using features provided by
Envoy to implement the API Gateway instead of the earlier referenced Ocelot. We made this design
choice because of Envoy’s built-in support for the WebSocket protocol, required by the new gRPC
inter-service communications implemented in eShopOnContainers. However, we’ve retained this
section in the guide so you can consider Ocelot as a simple, capable, and lightweight API Gateway
suitable for production-grade scenarios. Also, latest Ocelot version contains a breaking change on its
json schema. Consider using Ocelot < v16.0.0, or use the key Routes instead of ReRoutes.
Architect and design your API Gateways
The following architecture diagram shows how API Gateways were implemented with Ocelot in
eShopOnContainers.
163 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Figure 6-28. eShopOnContainers architecture with API Gateways
That diagram shows how the whole application is deployed into a single Docker host or development
PC with “Docker for Windows” or “Docker for Mac”. However, deploying into any orchestrator would
be similar, but any container in the diagram could be scaled out in the orchestrator.
In addition, the infrastructure assets such as databases, cache, and message brokers should be
offloaded from the orchestrator and deployed into high available systems for infrastructure, like Azure
SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Redis, Azure Service Bus, or any HA clustering solution on-
premises.
As you can also notice in the diagram, having several API Gateways allows multiple development
teams to be autonomous (in this case Marketing features vs. Shopping features) when developing and
deploying their microservices plus their own related API Gateways.
If you had a single monolithic API Gateway that would mean a single point to be updated by several
development teams, which could couple all the microservices with a single part of the application.
Going much further in the design, sometimes a fine-grained API Gateway can also be limited to a
single business microservice depending on the chosen architecture. Having the API Gateway’s
boundaries dictated by the business or domain will help you to get a better design.
For instance, fine granularity in the API Gateway tier can be especially useful for more advanced
composite UI applications that are based on microservices, because the concept of a fine-grained API
Gateway is similar to a UI composition service.
We delve into more details in the previous section Creating composite UI based on microservices.
As a key takeaway, for many medium- and large-size applications, using a custom-built API Gateway
product is usually a good approach, but not as a single monolithic aggregator or unique central
custom API Gateway unless that API Gateway allows multiple independent configuration areas for the
several development teams creating autonomous microservices.
164 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


Sample microservices/containers to reroute through the API Gateways
As an example, eShopOnContainers has around six internal microservice-types that have to be
published through the API Gateways, as shown in the following image.
Figure 6-29. Microservice folders in eShopOnContainers solution in Visual Studio
About the Identity service, in the design it’s left out of the API Gateway routing because it’s the only
cross-cutting concern in the system, although with Ocelot it’s also possible to include it as part of the
rerouting lists.
All those services are currently implemented as ASP.NET Core Web API services, as you can tell from
the code. Let’s focus on one of the microservices like the Catalog microservice code.
Figure 6-30. Sample Web API microservice (Catalog microservice)
165 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications




---

You can see that the Catalog microservice is a typical ASP.NET Core Web API project with several
controllers and methods like in the following code.
[HttpGet]
[Route("items/{id:int}")]
[ProducesResponseType((int)HttpStatusCode.BadRequest)]
[ProducesResponseType((int)HttpStatusCode.NotFound)]
[ProducesResponseType(typeof(CatalogItem),(int)HttpStatusCode.OK)]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetItemById(int id)
{
if (id <= 0)
{
return BadRequest();
}
var item = await _catalogContext.CatalogItems.
SingleOrDefaultAsync(ci => ci.Id == id);
//…
if (item != null)
{
return Ok(item);
}
return NotFound();
}
The HTTP request will end up running that kind of C# code accessing the microservice database and
any additional required action.
Regarding the microservice URL, when the containers are deployed in your local development PC
(local Docker host), each microservice’s container always has an internal port (usually port 80)
specified in its dockerfile, as in the following dockerfile:
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
The port 80 shown in the code is internal within the Docker host, so it can’t be reached by client apps.
Client apps can access only the external ports (if any) published when deploying with docker-
compose.
Those external ports shouldn’t be published when deploying to a production environment. For this
specific reason, why you want to use the API Gateway, to avoid the direct communication between the
client apps and the microservices.
However, when developing, you want to access the microservice/container directly and run it through
Swagger. That’s why in eShopOnContainers, the external ports are still specified even when they won’t
be used by the API Gateway or the client apps.
Here’s an example of the docker-compose.override.yml file for the Catalog microservice:
catalog-api:
environment:
- ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
- ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://0.0.0.0:80
- ConnectionString=YOUR_VALUE
- ... Other Environment Variables
166 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

ports:
- "5101:80" # Important: In a production environment you should remove the external
port (5101) kept here for microservice debugging purposes.
# The API Gateway redirects and access through the internal port (80).
You can see how in the docker-compose.override.yml configuration the internal port for the Catalog
container is port 80, but the port for external access is 5101. But this port shouldn’t be used by the
application when using an API Gateway, only to debug, run, and test just the Catalog microservice.
Normally, you won’t be deploying with docker-compose into a production environment because the
right production deployment environment for microservices is an orchestrator like Kubernetes or
Service Fabric. When deploying to those environments you use different configuration files where you
won’t publish directly any external port for the microservices but, you’ll always use the reverse proxy
from the API Gateway.
Run the catalog microservice in your local Docker host. Either run the full eShopOnContainers solution
from Visual Studio (it runs all the services in the docker-compose files), or start the Catalog
microservice with the following docker-compose command in CMD or PowerShell positioned at the
folder where the docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.override.yml are placed.
docker-compose run --service-ports catalog-api
This command only runs the catalog-api service container plus dependencies that are specified in the
docker-compose.yml. In this case, the SQL Server container and RabbitMQ container.
Then, you can directly access the Catalog microservice and see its methods through the Swagger UI
accessing directly through that “external” port, in this case http://host.docker.internal:5101/swagger:
167 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Figure 6-31. Testing the Catalog microservice with its Swagger UI
At this point, you could set a breakpoint in C# code in Visual Studio, test the microservice with the
methods exposed in Swagger UI, and finally clean-up everything with the docker-compose down
command.
However, direct-access communication to the microservice, in this case through the external port
5101, is precisely what you want to avoid in your application. And you can avoid that by setting the
additional level of indirection of the API Gateway (Ocelot, in this case). That way, the client app won’t
directly access the microservice.
Implementing your API Gateways with Ocelot
Ocelot is basically a set of middleware that you can apply in a specific order.
Ocelot is designed to work with ASP.NET Core only. The latest version of the package is 18.0 which
targets .NET 6 and hence is not suitable for .NET Framework applications.
168 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


You install Ocelot and its dependencies in your ASP.NET Core project with Ocelot’s NuGet package,
from Visual Studio.
Install-Package Ocelot
In eShopOnContainers, its API Gateway implementation is a simple ASP.NET Core WebHost project,
and Ocelot’s middleware handles all the API Gateway features, as shown in the following image:
Figure 6-32. The OcelotApiGw base project in eShopOnContainers
This ASP.NET Core WebHost project is built with two simple files: Program.cs and Startup.cs.
The Program.cs just needs to create and configure the typical ASP.NET Core BuildWebHost.
namespace OcelotApiGw
{
public class Program
{
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
BuildWebHost(args).Run();
}
public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args)
{
var builder = WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args);
builder.ConfigureServices(s => s.AddSingleton(builder))
.ConfigureAppConfiguration(
ic => ic.AddJsonFile(Path.Combine("configuration",
"configuration.json")))
.UseStartup<Startup>();
var host = builder.Build();
return host;
}
}
}
169 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


The important point here for Ocelot is the configuration.json file that you must provide to the builder
through the AddJsonFile() method. That configuration.json is where you specify all the API Gateway
ReRoutes, meaning the external endpoints with specific ports and the correlated internal endpoints,
usually using different ports.
{
"ReRoutes": [],
"GlobalConfiguration": {}
}
There are two sections to the configuration. An array of ReRoutes and a GlobalConfiguration. The
ReRoutes are the objects that tell Ocelot how to treat an upstream request. The Global configuration
allows overrides of ReRoute specific settings. It’s useful if you don’t want to manage lots of ReRoute
specific settings.
Here’s a simplified example of ReRoute configuration file from one of the API Gateways from
eShopOnContainers.
{
"ReRoutes": [
{
"DownstreamPathTemplate": "/api/{version}/{everything}",
"DownstreamScheme": "http",
"DownstreamHostAndPorts": [
{
"Host": "catalog-api",
"Port": 80
}
],
"UpstreamPathTemplate": "/api/{version}/c/{everything}",
"UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "POST", "PUT", "GET" ]
},
{
"DownstreamPathTemplate": "/api/{version}/{everything}",
"DownstreamScheme": "http",
"DownstreamHostAndPorts": [
{
"Host": "basket-api",
"Port": 80
}
],
"UpstreamPathTemplate": "/api/{version}/b/{everything}",
"UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "POST", "PUT", "GET" ],
"AuthenticationOptions": {
"AuthenticationProviderKey": "IdentityApiKey",
"AllowedScopes": []
}
}
],
"GlobalConfiguration": {
"RequestIdKey": "OcRequestId",
"AdministrationPath": "/administration"
}
}
170 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

The main functionality of an Ocelot API Gateway is to take incoming HTTP requests and forward them
on to a downstream service, currently as another HTTP request. Ocelot’s describes the routing of one
request to another as a ReRoute.
For instance, let’s focus on one of the ReRoutes in the configuration.json from above, the
configuration for the Basket microservice.
{
"DownstreamPathTemplate": "/api/{version}/{everything}",
"DownstreamScheme": "http",
"DownstreamHostAndPorts": [
{
"Host": "basket-api",
"Port": 80
}
],
"UpstreamPathTemplate": "/api/{version}/b/{everything}",
"UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "POST", "PUT", "GET" ],
"AuthenticationOptions": {
"AuthenticationProviderKey": "IdentityApiKey",
"AllowedScopes": []
}
}
The DownstreamPathTemplate, Scheme, and DownstreamHostAndPorts make the internal
microservice URL that this request will be forwarded to.
The port is the internal port used by the service. When using containers, the port specified at its
dockerfile.
The Host is a service name that depends on the service name resolution you are using. When using
docker-compose, the services names are provided by the Docker Host, which is using the service
names provided in the docker-compose files. If using an orchestrator like Kubernetes or Service
Fabric, that name should be resolved by the DNS or name resolution provided by each orchestrator.
DownstreamHostAndPorts is an array that contains the host and port of any downstream services that
you wish to forward requests to. Usually this configuration will just contain one entry but sometimes
you might want to load balance requests to your downstream services and Ocelot lets you add more
than one entry and then select a load balancer. But if using Azure and any orchestrator it is probably a
better idea to load balance with the cloud and orchestrator infrastructure.
The UpstreamPathTemplate is the URL that Ocelot will use to identify which
DownstreamPathTemplate to use for a given request from the client. Finally, the
UpstreamHttpMethod is used so Ocelot can distinguish between different requests (GET, POST, PUT)
to the same URL.
At this point, you could have a single Ocelot API Gateway (ASP.NET Core WebHost) using one or
multiple merged configuration.json files or you can also store the configuration in a Consul KV store.
But as introduced in the architecture and design sections, if you really want to have autonomous
microservices, it might be better to split that single monolithic API Gateway into multiple API
Gateways and/or BFF (Backend for Frontend). For that purpose, let’s see how to implement that
approach with Docker containers.
171 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Using a single Docker container image to run multiple different API Gateway / BFF
container types
In eShopOnContainers, we’re using a single Docker container image with the Ocelot API Gateway but
then, at run time, we create different services/containers for each type of API-Gateway/BFF by
providing a different configuration.json file, using a docker volume to access a different PC folder for
each service.
Figure 6-33. Reusing a single Ocelot Docker image across multiple API Gateway types
In eShopOnContainers, the “Generic Ocelot API Gateway Docker Image” is created with the project
named ‘OcelotApiGw’ and the image name “eshop/ocelotapigw” that is specified in the docker-
compose.yml file. Then, when deploying to Docker, there will be four API-Gateway containers created
from that same Docker image, as shown in the following extract from the docker-compose.yml file.
mobileshoppingapigw:
image: eshop/ocelotapigw:${TAG:-latest}
172 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


build:
context: .
dockerfile: src/ApiGateways/ApiGw-Base/Dockerfile
mobilemarketingapigw:
image: eshop/ocelotapigw:${TAG:-latest}
build:
context: .
dockerfile: src/ApiGateways/ApiGw-Base/Dockerfile
webshoppingapigw:
image: eshop/ocelotapigw:${TAG:-latest}
build:
context: .
dockerfile: src/ApiGateways/ApiGw-Base/Dockerfile
webmarketingapigw:
image: eshop/ocelotapigw:${TAG:-latest}
build:
context: .
dockerfile: src/ApiGateways/ApiGw-Base/Dockerfile
Additionally, as you can see in the following docker-compose.override.yml file, the only difference
between those API Gateway containers is the Ocelot configuration file, which is different for each
service container and it’s specified at run time through a Docker volume.
mobileshoppingapigw:
environment:
- ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
- IdentityUrl=http://identity-api
ports:
- "5200:80"
volumes:
- ./src/ApiGateways/Mobile.Bff.Shopping/apigw:/app/configuration
mobilemarketingapigw:
environment:
- ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
- IdentityUrl=http://identity-api
ports:
- "5201:80"
volumes:
- ./src/ApiGateways/Mobile.Bff.Marketing/apigw:/app/configuration
webshoppingapigw:
environment:
- ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
- IdentityUrl=http://identity-api
ports:
- "5202:80"
volumes:
- ./src/ApiGateways/Web.Bff.Shopping/apigw:/app/configuration
webmarketingapigw:
environment:
- ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
- IdentityUrl=http://identity-api
ports:
- "5203:80"
173 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

volumes:
- ./src/ApiGateways/Web.Bff.Marketing/apigw:/app/configuration
Because of that previous code, and as shown in the Visual Studio Explorer below, the only file needed
to define each specific business/BFF API Gateway is just a configuration.json file, because the four API
Gateways are based on the same Docker image.
Figure 6-34. The only file needed to define each API Gateway / BFF with Ocelot is a configuration file
By splitting the API Gateway into multiple API Gateways, different development teams focusing on
different subsets of microservices can manage their own API Gateways by using independent Ocelot
configuration files. Plus, at the same time they can reuse the same Ocelot Docker image.
Now, if you run eShopOnContainers with the API Gateways (included by default in VS when opening
eShopOnContainers-ServicesAndWebApps.sln solution or if running “docker-compose up”), the
following sample routes will be performed.
For instance, when visiting the upstream URL
http://host.docker.internal:5202/api/v1/c/catalog/items/2/ served by the webshoppingapigw API
Gateway, you get the same result from the internal Downstream URL http://catalog-api/api/v1/2
within the Docker host, as in the following browser.
Figure 6-35. Accessing a microservice through a URL provided by the API Gateway
Because of testing or debugging reasons, if you wanted to directly access to the Catalog Docker
container (only at the development environment) without passing through the API Gateway, since
‘catalog-api’ is a DNS resolution internal to the Docker host (service discovery handled by docker-
compose service names), the only way to directly access the container is through the external port
published in the docker-compose.override.yml, which is provided only for development tests, such as
http://host.docker.internal:5101/api/v1/Catalog/items/1 in the following browser.
174 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications



Figure 6-36. Direct access to a microservice for testing purposes
But the application is configured so it accesses all the microservices through the API Gateways, not
through the direct port “shortcuts”.
The Gateway aggregation pattern in eShopOnContainers
As introduced previously, a flexible way to implement requests aggregation is with custom services, by
code. You could also implement request aggregation with the Request Aggregation feature in Ocelot,
but it might not be as flexible as you need. Therefore, the selected way to implement aggregation in
eShopOnContainers is with an explicit ASP.NET Core Web API service for each aggregator.
According to that approach, the API Gateway composition diagram is in reality a bit more extended
when considering the aggregator services that are not shown in the simplified global architecture
diagram shown previously.
In the following diagram, you can also see how the aggregator services work with their related API
Gateways.
Figure 6-37. eShopOnContainers architecture with aggregator services
Zooming in further, on the “Shopping” business area in the following image, you can see that
chattiness between the client apps and the microservices is reduced when using the aggregator
services in the API Gateways.
175 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications




---

Figure 6-38. Zoom in vision of the Aggregator services
You can notice how when the diagram shows the possible requests coming from the API Gateways it
can get complex. On the other hand, when you use the aggregator pattern, you can see how the
arrows in blue would simplify the communication from a client app perspective. This pattern not only
helps to reduce the chattiness and latency in the communication, it also improves the user experience
significantly for the remote apps (mobile and SPA apps).
In the case of the “Marketing” business area and microservices, it is a simple use case so there was no
need to use aggregators, but it could also be possible, if needed.
Authentication and authorization in Ocelot API Gateways
In an Ocelot API Gateway, you can sit the authentication service, such as an ASP.NET Core Web API
service using IdentityServer providing the auth token, either out or inside the API Gateway.
Since eShopOnContainers is using multiple API Gateways with boundaries based on BFF and business
areas, the Identity/Auth service is left out of the API Gateways, as highlighted in yellow in the
following diagram.
176 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


Figure 6-39. Position of the Identity service in eShopOnContainers
However, Ocelot also supports sitting the Identity/Auth microservice within the API Gateway
boundary, as in this other diagram.
Figure 6-40. Authentication in Ocelot
As the previous diagram shows, when the Identity microservice is beneath the API gateway (AG): 1) AG
requests an auth token from identity microservice, 2) The identity microservice returns token to AG, 3-
4) AG requests from microservices using the auth token. Because eShopOnContainers application has
split the API Gateway into multiple BFF (Backend for Frontend) and business areas API Gateways,
another option would have been to create an additional API Gateway for cross-cutting concerns. That
choice would be fair in a more complex microservice based architecture with multiple cross-cutting
concerns microservices. Since there’s only one cross-cutting concern in eShopOnContainers, it was
decided to just handle the security service out of the API Gateway realm, for simplicity’s sake.
177 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications



In any case, if the app is secured at the API Gateway level, the authentication module of the Ocelot
API Gateway is visited at first when trying to use any secured microservice. That redirects the HTTP
request to visit the Identity or auth microservice to get the access token so you can visit the protected
services with the access_token.
The way you secure with authentication any service at the API Gateway level is by setting the
AuthenticationProviderKey in its related settings at the configuration.json.
{
"DownstreamPathTemplate": "/api/{version}/{everything}",
"DownstreamScheme": "http",
"DownstreamHostAndPorts": [
{
"Host": "basket-api",
"Port": 80
}
],
"UpstreamPathTemplate": "/api/{version}/b/{everything}",
"UpstreamHttpMethod": [],
"AuthenticationOptions": {
"AuthenticationProviderKey": "IdentityApiKey",
"AllowedScopes": []
}
}
When Ocelot runs, it will look at the ReRoutes AuthenticationOptions.AuthenticationProviderKey and
check that there is an Authentication Provider registered with the given key. If there isn’t, then Ocelot
will not start up. If there is, then the ReRoute will use that provider when it executes.
Because the Ocelot WebHost is configured with the authenticationProviderKey = "IdentityApiKey",
that will require authentication whenever that service has any requests without any auth token.
namespace OcelotApiGw
{
public class Startup
{
private readonly IConfiguration _cfg;
public Startup(IConfiguration configuration) => _cfg = configuration;
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
var identityUrl = _cfg.GetValue<string>("IdentityUrl");
var authenticationProviderKey = "IdentityApiKey";
//…
services.AddAuthentication()
.AddJwtBearer(authenticationProviderKey, x =>
{
x.Authority = identityUrl;
x.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
x.TokenValidationParameters = new
Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.TokenValidationParameters()
{
ValidAudiences = new[] { "orders", "basket", "locations",
"marketing", "mobileshoppingagg", "webshoppingagg" }
};
});
//...
178 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

}
}
}
Then, you also need to set authorization with the [Authorize] attribute on any resource to be accessed
like the microservices, such as in the following Basket microservice controller.
namespace Microsoft.eShopOnContainers.Services.Basket.API.Controllers
{
[Route("api/v1/[controller]")]
[Authorize]
public class BasketController : Controller
{
//...
}
}
The ValidAudiences such as “basket” are correlated with the audience defined in each microservice
with AddJwtBearer() at the ConfigureServices() of the Startup class, such as in the code below.
// prevent from mapping "sub" claim to nameidentifier.
JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();
var identityUrl = Configuration.GetValue<string>("IdentityUrl");
services.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
}).AddJwtBearer(options =>
{
options.Authority = identityUrl;
options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
options.Audience = "basket";
});
If you try to access any secured microservice, like the Basket microservice with a ReRoute URL based
on the API Gateway like http://host.docker.internal:5202/api/v1/b/basket/1, then you’ll get a 401
Unauthorized unless you provide a valid token. On the other hand, if a ReRoute URL is authenticated,
Ocelot will invoke whatever downstream scheme is associated with it (the internal microservice URL).
Authorization at Ocelot’s ReRoutes tier. Ocelot supports claims-based authorization evaluated after
the authentication. You set the authorization at a route level by adding the following lines to the
ReRoute configuration.
"RouteClaimsRequirement": {
"UserType": "employee"
}
In that example, when the authorization middleware is called, Ocelot will find if the user has the claim
type ‘UserType’ in the token and if the value of that claim is ‘employee’. If it isn’t, then the user will not
be authorized and the response will be 403 forbidden.
179 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications

Using Kubernetes Ingress plus Ocelot API Gateways
When using Kubernetes (like in an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster), you usually unify all the HTTP
requests through the Kubernetes Ingress tier based on Nginx.
In Kubernetes, if you don’t use any ingress approach, then your services and pods have IPs only
routable by the cluster network.
But if you use an ingress approach, you’ll have a middle tier between the Internet and your services
(including your API Gateways), acting as a reverse proxy.
As a definition, an Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the cluster
services. An ingress is configured to provide services externally reachable URLs, load balance traffic,
SSL termination and more. Users request ingress by POSTing the Ingress resource to the API server.
In eShopOnContainers, when developing locally and using just your development machine as the
Docker host, you are not using any ingress but only the multiple API Gateways.
However, when targeting a “production” environment based on Kubernetes, eShopOnContainers is
using an ingress in front of the API gateways. That way, the clients still call the same base URL but the
requests are routed to multiple API Gateways or BFF.
API Gateways are front-ends or façades surfacing only the services but not the web applications that
are usually out of their scope. In addition, the API Gateways might hide certain internal microservices.
The ingress, however, is just redirecting HTTP requests but not trying to hide any microservice or web
app.
Having an ingress Nginx tier in Kubernetes in front of the web applications plus the several Ocelot API
Gateways / BFF is the ideal architecture, as shown in the following diagram.
Figure 6-41. The ingress tier in eShopOnContainers when deployed into Kubernetes
A Kubernetes Ingress acts as a reverse proxy for all traffic to the app, including the web applications,
that are out of the Api gateway scope. When you deploy eShopOnContainers into Kubernetes, it
180 CHAPTER 5 | Designing and Developing Multi-Container and Microservice-Based .NET Applications


exposes just a few services or endpoints via ingress, basically the following list of postfixes on the
URLs:
• / for the client SPA web application
• /webmvc for the client MVC web application
• /webstatus for the client web app showing the status/healthchecks
• /webshoppingapigw for the web BFF and shopping business processes
• /webmarketingapigw for the web BFF and marketing business processes
• /mobileshoppingapigw for the mobile BFF and shopping business processes
• /mobilemarketingapigw for the mobile BFF and marketing business processes
When deploying to Kubernetes, each Ocelot API Gateway is using a different “configuration.json” file
for each pod running the API Gateways. Those “configuration.json” files are provided by mounting
(originally with the deploy.ps1 script) a volume created based on a Kubernetes config map named
‘ocelot’. Each container mounts its related configuration file in the container’s folder named
/app/configuration.
In the source code files of eShopOnContainers, the original “configuration.json” files can be found
within the k8s/ocelot/ folder. There’s one file for each BFF/APIGateway.
Additional cross-cutting features in an Ocelot API Gateway
There are other important features to research and use, when using an Ocelot API Gateway, described
in the following links.
• Service discovery in the client side integrating Ocelot with Consul or Eureka

Tackle Business
Complexity in a
Microservice with DDD
and CQRS Patterns
Design a domain model for each microservice or Bounded Context that reflects understanding of the
business domain.
This section focuses on more advanced microservices that you implement when you need to tackle
complex subsystems, or microservices derived from the knowledge of domain experts with ever-
changing business rules. The architecture patterns used in this section are based on domain-driven
design (DDD) and Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) approaches, as illustrated
in Figure 7-1.
182 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Figure 7-1. External microservice architecture versus internal architecture patterns for each microservice
However, most of the techniques for data driven microservices, such as how to implement an ASP.NET
Core Web API service or how to expose Swagger metadata with Swashbuckle or NSwag, are also
applicable to the more advanced microservices implemented internally with DDD patterns. This
section is an extension of the previous sections, because most of the practices explained earlier also
apply here or for any kind of microservice.
This section first provides details on the simplified CQRS patterns used in the eShopOnContainers
reference application. Later, you will get an overview of the DDD techniques that enable you to find
common patterns that you can reuse in your applications.
DDD is a large topic with a rich set of resources for learning. You can start with books like Domain-
Driven Design by Eric Evans and additional materials from Vaughn Vernon, Jimmy Nilsson, Greg
Young, Udi Dahan, Jimmy Bogard, and many other DDD/CQRS experts. But most of all you need to try
to learn how to apply DDD techniques from the conversations, whiteboarding, and domain modeling
sessions with the experts in your concrete business domain.

Apply simplified CQRS and DDD patterns in a
microservice
CQRS is an architectural pattern that separates the models for reading and writing data. The related
term Command Query Separation (CQS) was originally defined by Bertrand Meyer in his book Object-
Oriented Software Construction. The basic idea is that you can divide a system’s operations into two
sharply separated categories:
• Queries. These queries return a result and don’t change the state of the system, and they’re
free of side effects.
• Commands. These commands change the state of a system.
184 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

CQS is a simple concept: it is about methods within the same object being either queries or
commands. Each method either returns state or mutates state, but not both. Even a single repository
pattern object can comply with CQS. CQS can be considered a foundational principle for CQRS.
Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) was introduced by Greg Young and strongly
promoted by Udi Dahan and others. It’s based on the CQS principle, although it’s more detailed. It can
be considered a pattern based on commands and events plus optionally on asynchronous messages.
In many cases, CQRS is related to more advanced scenarios, like having a different physical database
for reads (queries) than for writes (updates). Moreover, a more evolved CQRS system might
implement Event-Sourcing (ES) for your updates database, so you would only store events in the
domain model instead of storing the current-state data. However, this approach is not used in this
guide. This guide uses the simplest CQRS approach, which consists of just separating the queries from
the commands.
The separation aspect of CQRS is achieved by grouping query operations in one layer and commands
in another layer. Each layer has its own data model (note that we say model, not necessarily a different
database) and is built using its own combination of patterns and technologies. More importantly, the
two layers can be within the same tier or microservice, as in the example (ordering microservice) used
for this guide. Or they could be implemented on different microservices or processes so they can be
optimized and scaled out separately without affecting one another.
CQRS means having two objects for a read/write operation where in other contexts there’s one. There
are reasons to have a denormalized reads database, which you can learn about in more advanced
CQRS literature. But we aren’t using that approach here, where the goal is to have more flexibility in
the queries instead of limiting the queries with constraints from DDD patterns like aggregates.
An example of this kind of service is the ordering microservice from the eShopOnContainers reference
application. This service implements a microservice based on a simplified CQRS approach. It uses a
single data source or database, but two logical models plus DDD patterns for the transactional
domain, as shown in Figure 7-2.
185 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


---

Figure 7-2. Simplified CQRS- and DDD-based microservice
The Logical “Ordering” Microservice includes its Ordering database, which can be, but doesn’t have to
be, the same Docker host. Having the database in the same Docker host is good for development, but
not for production.
The application layer can be the Web API itself. The important design aspect here is that the
microservice has split the queries and ViewModels (data models especially created for the client
applications) from the commands, domain model, and transactions following the CQRS pattern. This
approach keeps the queries independent from restrictions and constraints coming from DDD patterns
that only make sense for transactions and updates, as explained in later sections.

Apply CQRS and CQS approaches in a DDD
microservice in eShopOnContainers
The design of the ordering microservice at the eShopOnContainers reference application is based on
CQRS principles. However, it uses the simplest approach, which is just separating the queries from the
commands and using the same database for both actions.
The essence of those patterns, and the important point here, is that queries are idempotent: no matter
how many times you query a system, the state of that system won’t change. In other words, queries
are side-effect free.
186 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


Therefore, you could use a different “reads” data model than the transactional logic “writes” domain
model, even though the ordering microservices are using the same database. Hence, this is a
simplified CQRS approach.
On the other hand, commands, which trigger transactions and data updates, change state in the
system. With commands, you need to be careful when dealing with complexity and ever-changing
business rules. This is where you want to apply DDD techniques to have a better modeled system.
The DDD patterns presented in this guide should not be applied universally. They introduce
constraints on your design. Those constraints provide benefits such as higher quality over time,
especially in commands and other code that modifies system state. However, those constraints add
complexity with fewer benefits for reading and querying data.
One such pattern is the Aggregate pattern, which we examine more in later sections. Briefly, in the
Aggregate pattern, you treat many domain objects as a single unit as a result of their relationship in
the domain. You might not always gain advantages from this pattern in queries; it can increase the
complexity of query logic. For read-only queries, you do not get the advantages of treating multiple
objects as a single Aggregate. You only get the complexity.
As shown in Figure 7-2 in the previous section, this guide suggests using DDD patterns only in the
transactional/updates area of your microservice (that is, as triggered by commands). Queries can
follow a simpler approach and should be separated from commands, following a CQRS approach.
For implementing the “queries side”, you can choose between many approaches, from your full-blown
ORM like EF Core, AutoMapper projections, stored procedures, views, materialized views or a micro
ORM.
In this guide and in eShopOnContainers (specifically the ordering microservice) we chose to
implement straight queries using a micro ORM like Dapper. This guide lets you implement any query
based on SQL statements to get the best performance, thanks to a light framework with little
overhead.
When you use this approach, any updates to your model that impact how entities are persisted to a
SQL database also need separate updates to SQL queries used by Dapper or any other separate (non-
EF) approaches to querying.
CQRS and DDD patterns are not top-level architectures
It’s important to understand that CQRS and most DDD patterns (like DDD layers or a domain model
with aggregates) are not architectural styles, but only architecture patterns. Microservices, SOA, and
event-driven architecture (EDA) are examples of architectural styles. They describe a system of many
components, such as many microservices. CQRS and DDD patterns describe something inside a single
system or component; in this case, something inside a microservice.
Different Bounded Contexts (BCs) will employ different patterns. They have different responsibilities,
and that leads to different solutions. It is worth emphasizing that forcing the same pattern everywhere
leads to failure. Do not use CQRS and DDD patterns everywhere. Many subsystems, BCs, or
microservices are simpler and can be implemented more easily using simple CRUD services or using
another approach.
187 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

There is only one application architecture: the architecture of the system or end-to-end application
you are designing (for example, the microservices architecture). However, the design of each Bounded
Context or microservice within that application reflects its own tradeoffs and internal design decisions
at an architecture patterns level. Do not try to apply the same architectural patterns as CQRS or DDD
everywhere.

Implement reads/queries in a CQRS microservice
For reads/queries, the ordering microservice from the eShopOnContainers reference application
implements the queries independently from the DDD model and transactional area. This
implementation was done primarily because the demands for queries and for transactions are
drastically different. Writes execute transactions that must be compliant with the domain logic.
Queries, on the other hand, are idempotent and can be segregated from the domain rules.
The approach is simple, as shown in Figure 7-3. The API interface is implemented by the Web API
controllers using any infrastructure, such as a micro Object Relational Mapper (ORM) like Dapper, and
returning dynamic ViewModels depending on the needs of the UI applications.
Figure 7-3. The simplest approach for queries in a CQRS microservice
The simplest approach for the queries-side in a simplified CQRS approach can be implemented by
querying the database with a Micro-ORM like Dapper, returning dynamic ViewModels. The query
188 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


definitions query the database and return a dynamic ViewModel built on the fly for each query. Since
the queries are idempotent, they won’t change the data no matter how many times you run a query.
Therefore, you don’t need to be restricted by any DDD pattern used in the transactional side, like
aggregates and other patterns, and that is why queries are separated from the transactional area. You
query the database for the data that the UI needs and return a dynamic ViewModel that does not
need to be statically defined anywhere (no classes for the ViewModels) except in the SQL statements
themselves.
Since this approach is simple, the code required for the queries side (such as code using a micro ORM
like Dapper) can be implemented within the same Web API project. Figure 7-4 shows this approach.
The queries are defined in the Ordering.API microservice project within the eShopOnContainers
solution.
Figure 7-4. Queries in the Ordering microservice in eShopOnContainers
Use ViewModels specifically made for client apps, independent from
domain model constraints
Since the queries are performed to obtain the data needed by the client applications, the returned
type can be specifically made for the clients, based on the data returned by the queries. These models,
or Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), are called ViewModels.
The returned data (ViewModel) can be the result of joining data from multiple entities or tables in the
database, or even across multiple aggregates defined in the domain model for the transactional area.
In this case, because you are creating queries independent of the domain model, the aggregates
boundaries and constraints are ignored and you’re free to query any table and column you might
need. This approach provides great flexibility and productivity for the developers creating or updating
the queries.
The ViewModels can be static types defined in classes (as is implemented in the ordering
microservice). Or they can be created dynamically based on the queries performed, which is agile for
developers.
Use Dapper as a micro ORM to perform queries
You can use any micro ORM, Entity Framework Core, or even plain ADO.NET for querying. In the
sample application, Dapper was selected for the ordering microservice in eShopOnContainers as a
good example of a popular micro ORM. It can run plain SQL queries with great performance, because
it’s a light framework. Using Dapper, you can write a SQL query that can access and join multiple
tables.
189 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


Dapper is an open-source project (original created by Sam Saffron), and is part of the building blocks
used in Stack Overflow. To use Dapper, you just need to install it through the Dapper NuGet package,
as shown in the following figure:
You also need to add a using directive so your code has access to the Dapper extension methods.
When you use Dapper in your code, you directly use the SqlConnection class available in the
Microsoft.Data.SqlClient namespace. Through the QueryAsync method and other extension methods
that extend the SqlConnection class, you can run queries in a straightforward and performant way.
Dynamic versus static ViewModels
When returning ViewModels from the server-side to client apps, you can think about those
ViewModels as DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) that can be different to the internal domain entities of
your entity model because the ViewModels hold the data the way the client app needs. Therefore, in
many cases, you can aggregate data coming from multiple domain entities and compose the
ViewModels precisely according to how the client app needs that data.
Those ViewModels or DTOs can be defined explicitly (as data holder classes), like the OrderSummary
class shown in a later code snippet. Or, you could just return dynamic ViewModels or dynamic DTOs
based on the attributes returned by your queries as a dynamic type.
ViewModel as dynamic type
As shown in the following code, a ViewModel can be directly returned by the queries by just returning
a dynamic type that internally is based on the attributes returned by a query. That means that the
subset of attributes to be returned is based on the query itself. Therefore, if you add a new column to
the query or join, that data is dynamically added to the returned ViewModel.
using Dapper;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Dynamic;
using System.Collections.Generic;
public class OrderQueries : IOrderQueries
{
public async Task<IEnumerable<dynamic>> GetOrdersAsync()
{
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
{
connection.Open();
return await connection.QueryAsync<dynamic>(
@"SELECT o.[Id] as ordernumber,
o.[OrderDate] as [date],os.[Name] as [status],
SUM(oi.units*oi.unitprice) as total
FROM [ordering].[Orders] o
LEFT JOIN[ordering].[orderitems] oi ON o.Id = oi.orderid
LEFT JOIN[ordering].[orderstatus] os on o.OrderStatusId = os.Id
190 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


GROUP BY o.[Id], o.[OrderDate], os.[Name]");
}
}
}
The important point is that by using a dynamic type, the returned collection of data is dynamically
assembled as the ViewModel.
Pros: This approach reduces the need to modify static ViewModel classes whenever you update the
SQL sentence of a query, making this design approach agile when coding, straightforward, and quick
to evolve in regard to future changes.
Cons: In the long term, dynamic types can negatively impact the clarity and the compatibility of a
service with client apps. In addition, middleware software like Swashbuckle cannot provide the same
level of documentation on returned types if using dynamic types.
ViewModel as predefined DTO classes
Pros: Having static, predefined ViewModel classes, like “contracts” based on explicit DTO classes, is
definitely better for public APIs but also for long-term microservices, even if they are only used by the
same application.
If you want to specify response types for Swagger, you need to use explicit DTO classes as the return
type. Therefore, predefined DTO classes allow you to offer richer information from Swagger. That
improves the API documentation and compatibility when consuming an API.
Cons: As mentioned earlier, when updating the code, it takes some more steps to update the DTO
classes.
Tip based on our experience: In the queries implemented at the Ordering microservice in
eShopOnContainers, we started developing by using dynamic ViewModels as it was straightforward
and agile on the early development stages. But, once the development was stabilized, we chose to
refactor the APIs and use static or pre-defined DTOs for the ViewModels, because it is clearer for the
microservice’s consumers to know explicit DTO types, used as “contracts”.
In the following example, you can see how the query is returning data by using an explicit ViewModel
DTO class: the OrderSummary class.
using Dapper;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Dynamic;
using System.Collections.Generic;
public class OrderQueries : IOrderQueries
{
public async Task<IEnumerable<OrderSummary>> GetOrdersAsync()
{
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
{
connection.Open();
return await connection.QueryAsync<OrderSummary>(
@"SELECT o.[Id] as ordernumber,
o.[OrderDate] as [date],os.[Name] as [status],
191 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

SUM(oi.units*oi.unitprice) as total
FROM [ordering].[Orders] o
LEFT JOIN[ordering].[orderitems] oi ON o.Id = oi.orderid
LEFT JOIN[ordering].[orderstatus] os on o.OrderStatusId = os.Id
GROUP BY o.[Id], o.[OrderDate], os.[Name]
ORDER BY o.[Id]");
}
}
}
Describe response types of Web APIs
Developers consuming web APIs and microservices are most concerned with what is returned—
specifically response types and error codes (if not standard). The response types are handled in the
XML comments and data annotations.
Without proper documentation in the Swagger UI, the consumer lacks knowledge of what types are
being returned or what HTTP codes can be returned. That problem is fixed by adding the
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ProducesResponseTypeAttribute, so Swashbuckle can generate richer
information about the API return model and values, as shown in the following code:
namespace Microsoft.eShopOnContainers.Services.Ordering.API.Controllers
{
[Route("api/v1/[controller]")]
[Authorize]
public class OrdersController : Controller
{
//Additional code...
[Route("")]
[HttpGet]
[ProducesResponseType(typeof(IEnumerable<OrderSummary>),
(int)HttpStatusCode.OK)]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetOrders()
{
var userid = _identityService.GetUserIdentity();
var orders = await _orderQueries
.GetOrdersFromUserAsync(Guid.Parse(userid));
return Ok(orders);
}
}
}
However, the ProducesResponseType attribute cannot use dynamic as a type but requires to use
explicit types, like the OrderSummary ViewModel DTO, shown in the following example:
public class OrderSummary
{
public int ordernumber { get; set; }
public DateTime date { get; set; }
public string status { get; set; }
public double total { get; set; }
}
// or using C# 8 record types:
public record OrderSummary(int ordernumber, DateTime date, string status, double total);
192 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

This is another reason why explicit returned types are better than dynamic types, in the long term.
When using the ProducesResponseType attribute, you can also specify what is the expected outcome
regarding possible HTTP errors/codes, like 200, 400, etc.
In the following image, you can see how Swagger UI shows the ResponseType information.
Figure 7-5. Swagger UI showing response types and possible HTTP status codes from a Web API
The image shows some example values based on the ViewModel types and the possible HTTP status
codes that can be returned.

Design a DDD-oriented microservice
Domain-driven design (DDD) advocates modeling based on the reality of business as relevant to your
use cases. In the context of building applications, DDD talks about problems as domains. It describes
independent problem areas as Bounded Contexts (each Bounded Context correlates to a
microservice), and emphasizes a common language to talk about these problems. It also suggests
many technical concepts and patterns, like domain entities with rich models (no anemic-domain
model), value objects, aggregates, and aggregate root (or root entity) rules to support the internal
implementation. This section introduces the design and implementation of those internal patterns.
Sometimes these DDD technical rules and patterns are perceived as obstacles that have a steep
learning curve for implementing DDD approaches. But the important part is not the patterns
themselves, but organizing the code so it is aligned to the business problems, and using the same
business terms (ubiquitous language). In addition, DDD approaches should be applied only if you are
implementing complex microservices with significant business rules. Simpler responsibilities, like a
CRUD service, can be managed with simpler approaches.
Where to draw the boundaries is the key task when designing and defining a microservice. DDD
patterns help you understand the complexity in the domain. For the domain model for each Bounded
Context, you identify and define the entities, value objects, and aggregates that model your domain.
You build and refine a domain model that is contained within a boundary that defines your context.
And that is explicit in the form of a microservice. The components within those boundaries end up
being your microservices, although in some cases a BC or business microservices can be composed of
several physical services. DDD is about boundaries and so are microservices.
Keep the microservice context boundaries relatively small
Determining where to place boundaries between Bounded Contexts balances two competing goals.
First, you want to initially create the smallest possible microservices, although that should not be the
main driver; you should create a boundary around things that need cohesion. Second, you want to
avoid chatty communications between microservices. These goals can contradict one another. You
should balance them by decomposing the system into as many small microservices as you can until
you see communication boundaries growing quickly with each additional attempt to separate a new
Bounded Context. Cohesion is key within a single bounded context.
It is similar to the Inappropriate Intimacy code smell when implementing classes. If two microservices
need to collaborate a lot with each other, they should probably be the same microservice.
194 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Another way to look at this aspect is autonomy. If a microservice must rely on another service to
directly service a request, it is not truly autonomous.
Layers in DDD microservices
Most enterprise applications with significant business and technical complexity are defined by
multiple layers. The layers are a logical artifact, and are not related to the deployment of the service.
They exist to help developers manage the complexity in the code. Different layers (like the domain
model layer versus the presentation layer, etc.) might have different types, which mandate translations
between those types.
For example, an entity could be loaded from the database. Then part of that information, or an
aggregation of information including additional data from other entities, can be sent to the client UI
through a REST Web API. The point here is that the domain entity is contained within the domain
model layer and should not be propagated to other areas that it does not belong to, like to the
presentation layer.
Additionally, you need to have always-valid entities (see the Designing validations in the domain
model layer section) controlled by aggregate roots (root entities). Therefore, entities should not be
bound to client views, because at the UI level some data might still not be validated. This reason is
what the ViewModel is for. The ViewModel is a data model exclusively for presentation layer needs.
The domain entities do not belong directly to the ViewModel. Instead, you need to translate between
ViewModels and domain entities and vice versa.
When tackling complexity, it is important to have a domain model controlled by aggregate roots that
make sure that all the invariants and rules related to that group of entities (aggregate) are performed
through a single entry-point or gate, the aggregate root.
Figure 7-5 shows how a layered design is implemented in the eShopOnContainers application.
195 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


---

Figure 7-5. DDD layers in the ordering microservice in eShopOnContainers
The three layers in a DDD microservice like Ordering. Each layer is a VS project: Application layer is
Ordering.API, Domain layer is Ordering.Domain and the Infrastructure layer is Ordering.Infrastructure.
You want to design the system so that each layer communicates only with certain other layers. That
approach may be easier to enforce if layers are implemented as different class libraries, because you
can clearly identify what dependencies are set between libraries. For instance, the domain model layer
should not take a dependency on any other layer (the domain model classes should be Plain Old Class
Objects, or POCO, classes). As shown in Figure 7-6, the Ordering.Domain layer library has
dependencies only on the .NET libraries or NuGet packages, but not on any other custom library, such
as data library or persistence library.
Figure 7-6. Layers implemented as libraries allow better control of dependencies between layers
The domain model layer
Eric Evans’s excellent book Domain Driven Design says the following about the domain model layer
and the application layer.
Domain Model Layer: Responsible for representing concepts of the business, information about the
business situation, and business rules. State that reflects the business situation is controlled and used
here, even though the technical details of storing it are delegated to the infrastructure. This layer is
the heart of business software.
196 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns



The domain model layer is where the business is expressed. When you implement a microservice
domain model layer in .NET, that layer is coded as a class library with the domain entities that capture
data plus behavior (methods with logic).
Following the Persistence Ignorance and the Infrastructure Ignorance principles, this layer must
completely ignore data persistence details. These persistence tasks should be performed by the
infrastructure layer. Therefore, this layer should not take direct dependencies on the infrastructure,
which means that an important rule is that your domain model entity classes should be POCOs.
Domain entities should not have any direct dependency (like deriving from a base class) on any data
access infrastructure framework like Entity Framework or NHibernate. Ideally, your domain entities
should not derive from or implement any type defined in any infrastructure framework.
Most modern ORM frameworks like Entity Framework Core allow this approach, so that your domain
model classes are not coupled to the infrastructure. However, having POCO entities is not always
possible when using certain NoSQL databases and frameworks, like Actors and Reliable Collections in
Azure Service Fabric.
Even when it is important to follow the Persistence Ignorance principle for your Domain model, you
should not ignore persistence concerns. It is still important to understand the physical data model and
how it maps to your entity object model. Otherwise you can create impossible designs.
Also, this aspect does not mean you can take a model designed for a relational database and directly
move it to a NoSQL or document-oriented database. In some entity models, the model might fit, but
usually it does not. There are still constraints that your entity model must adhere to, based both on
the storage technology and ORM technology.
The application layer
Moving on to the application layer, we can again cite Eric Evans’s book Domain Driven Design:
Application Layer: Defines the jobs the software is supposed to do and directs the expressive domain
objects to work out problems. The tasks this layer is responsible for are meaningful to the business or
necessary for interaction with the application layers of other systems. This layer is kept thin. It does
not contain business rules or knowledge, but only coordinates tasks and delegates work to
collaborations of domain objects in the next layer down. It does not have state reflecting the business
situation, but it can have state that reflects the progress of a task for the user or the program.
A microservice’s application layer in .NET is commonly coded as an ASP.NET Core Web API project.
The project implements the microservice’s interaction, remote network access, and the external Web
APIs used from the UI or client apps. It includes queries if using a CQRS approach, commands
accepted by the microservice, and even the event-driven communication between microservices
(integration events). The ASP.NET Core Web API that represents the application layer must not contain
business rules or domain knowledge (especially domain rules for transactions or updates); these
should be owned by the domain model class library. The application layer must only coordinate tasks
and must not hold or define any domain state (domain model). It delegates the execution of business
rules to the domain model classes themselves (aggregate roots and domain entities), which will
ultimately update the data within those domain entities.
197 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Basically, the application logic is where you implement all use cases that depend on a given front end.
For example, the implementation related to a Web API service.
The goal is that the domain logic in the domain model layer, its invariants, the data model, and
related business rules must be completely independent from the presentation and application layers.
Most of all, the domain model layer must not directly depend on any infrastructure framework.
The infrastructure layer
The infrastructure layer is how the data that is initially held in domain entities (in memory) is persisted
in databases or another persistent store. An example is using Entity Framework Core code to
implement the Repository pattern classes that use a DBContext to persist data in a relational
database.
In accordance with the previously mentioned Persistence Ignorance and Infrastructure Ignorance
principles, the infrastructure layer must not “contaminate” the domain model layer. You must keep the
domain model entity classes agnostic from the infrastructure that you use to persist data (EF or any
other framework) by not taking hard dependencies on frameworks. Your domain model layer class
library should have only your domain code, just POCO entity classes implementing the heart of your
software and completely decoupled from infrastructure technologies.
Thus, your layers or class libraries and projects should ultimately depend on your domain model layer
(library), not vice versa, as shown in Figure 7-7.
Figure 7-7. Dependencies between layers in DDD
Dependencies in a DDD Service, the Application layer depends on Domain and Infrastructure, and
Infrastructure depends on Domain, but Domain doesn’t depend on any layer. This layer design should
be independent for each microservice. As noted earlier, you can implement the most complex
microservices following DDD patterns, while implementing simpler data-driven microservices (simple
CRUD in a single layer) in a simpler way.

Design a microservice domain model
Define one rich domain model for each business microservice or Bounded Context.
Your goal is to create a single cohesive domain model for each business microservice or Bounded
Context (BC). Keep in mind, however, that a BC or business microservice could sometimes be
composed of several physical services that share a single domain model. The domain model must
capture the rules, behavior, business language, and constraints of the single Bounded Context or
business microservice that it represents.
The Domain Entity pattern
Entities represent domain objects and are primarily defined by their identity, continuity, and
persistence over time, and not only by the attributes that comprise them. As Eric Evans says, “an
object primarily defined by its identity is called an Entity.” Entities are very important in the domain
model, since they are the base for a model. Therefore, you should identify and design them carefully.
An entity’s identity can cross multiple microservices or Bounded Contexts.
The same identity (that is, the same Id value, although perhaps not the same domain entity) can be
modeled across multiple Bounded Contexts or microservices. However, that does not imply that the
same entity, with the same attributes and logic would be implemented in multiple Bounded Contexts.
Instead, entities in each Bounded Context limit their attributes and behaviors to those required in that
Bounded Context’s domain.
For instance, the buyer entity might have most of a person’s attributes that are defined in the user
entity in the profile or identity microservice, including the identity. But the buyer entity in the ordering
microservice might have fewer attributes, because only certain buyer data is related to the order
process. The context of each microservice or Bounded Context impacts its domain model.
Domain entities must implement behavior in addition to implementing data attributes.
A domain entity in DDD must implement the domain logic or behavior related to the entity data (the
object accessed in memory). For example, as part of an order entity class you must have business logic
and operations implemented as methods for tasks such as adding an order item, data validation, and
total calculation. The entity’s methods take care of the invariants and rules of the entity instead of
having those rules spread across the application layer.
199 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Figure 7-8 shows a domain entity that implements not only data attributes but operations or methods
with related domain logic.
Figure 7-8. Example of a domain entity design implementing data plus behavior
A domain model entity implements behaviors through methods, that is, it’s not an “anemic” model. Of
course, sometimes you can have entities that do not implement any logic as part of the entity class.
This can happen in child entities within an aggregate if the child entity does not have any special logic
because most of the logic is defined in the aggregate root. If you have a complex microservice that
has logic implemented in the service classes instead of in the domain entities, you could be falling
into the anemic domain model, explained in the following section.
Rich domain model versus anemic domain model
In his post AnemicDomainModel, Martin Fowler describes an anemic domain model this way:
The basic symptom of an Anemic Domain Model is that at first blush it looks like the real thing. There
are objects, many named after the nouns in the domain space, and these objects are connected with
the rich relationships and structure that true domain models have. The catch comes when you look at
the behavior, and you realize that there is hardly any behavior on these objects, making them little
more than bags of getters and setters.
Of course, when you use an anemic domain model, those data models will be used from a set of
service objects (traditionally named the business layer) which capture all the domain or business logic.
The business layer sits on top of the data model and uses the data model just as data.
The anemic domain model is just a procedural style design. Anemic entity objects are not real objects
because they lack behavior (methods). They only hold data properties and thus it is not object-
oriented design. By putting all the behavior out into service objects (the business layer), you
essentially end up with spaghetti code or transaction scripts, and therefore you lose the advantages
that a domain model provides.
Regardless, if your microservice or Bounded Context is very simple (a CRUD service), the anemic
domain model in the form of entity objects with just data properties might be good enough, and it
might not be worth implementing more complex DDD patterns. In that case, it will be simply a
persistence model, because you have intentionally created an entity with only data for CRUD
purposes.
200 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


That is why microservices architectures are perfect for a multi-architectural approach depending on
each Bounded Context. For instance, in eShopOnContainers, the ordering microservice implements
DDD patterns, but the catalog microservice, which is a simple CRUD service, does not.
Some people say that the anemic domain model is an anti-pattern. It really depends on what you are
implementing. If the microservice you are creating is simple enough (for example, a CRUD service),
following the anemic domain model it is not an anti-pattern. However, if you need to tackle the
complexity of a microservice’s domain that has a lot of ever-changing business rules, the anemic
domain model might be an anti-pattern for that microservice or Bounded Context. In that case,
designing it as a rich model with entities containing data plus behavior as well as implementing
additional DDD patterns (aggregates, value objects, etc.) might have huge benefits for the long-term
success of such a microservice.

The Value Object pattern
As Eric Evans has noted, “Many objects do not have conceptual identity. These objects describe
certain characteristics of a thing.”
An entity requires an identity, but there are many objects in a system that do not, like the Value
Object pattern. A value object is an object with no conceptual identity that describes a domain aspect.
These are objects that you instantiate to represent design elements that only concern you temporarily.
You care about what they are, not who they are. Examples include numbers and strings, but can also
be higher-level concepts like groups of attributes.
Something that is an entity in a microservice might not be an entity in another microservice, because
in the second case, the Bounded Context might have a different meaning. For example, an address in
an e-commerce application might not have an identity at all, since it might only represent a group of
attributes of the customer’s profile for a person or company. In this case, the address should be
classified as a value object. However, in an application for an electric power utility company, the
customer address could be important for the business domain. Therefore, the address must have an
identity so the billing system can be directly linked to the address. In that case, an address should be
classified as a domain entity.
A person with a name and surname is usually an entity because a person has identity, even if the
name and surname coincide with another set of values, such as if those names also refer to a different
person.
Value objects are hard to manage in relational databases and ORMs like Entity Framework (EF),
whereas in document-oriented databases they are easier to implement and use.
201 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

EF Core 2.0 and later versions include the Owned Entities feature that makes it easier to handle value
objects, as we’ll see in detail later on.

The Aggregate pattern
A domain model contains clusters of different data entities and processes that can control a
significant area of functionality, such as order fulfillment or inventory. A more fine-grained DDD unit is
the aggregate, which describes a cluster or group of entities and behaviors that can be treated as a
cohesive unit.
You usually define an aggregate based on the transactions that you need. A classic example is an
order that also contains a list of order items. An order item will usually be an entity. But it will be a
child entity within the order aggregate, which will also contain the order entity as its root entity,
typically called an aggregate root.
Identifying aggregates can be hard. An aggregate is a group of objects that must be consistent
together, but you cannot just pick a group of objects and label them an aggregate. You must start
with a domain concept and think about the entities that are used in the most common transactions
related to that concept. Those entities that need to be transactionally consistent are what forms an
aggregate. Thinking about transaction operations is probably the best way to identify aggregates.
The Aggregate Root or Root Entity pattern
An aggregate is composed of at least one entity: the aggregate root, also called root entity or primary
entity. Additionally, it can have multiple child entities and value objects, with all entities and objects
working together to implement required behavior and transactions.
The purpose of an aggregate root is to ensure the consistency of the aggregate; it should be the only
entry point for updates to the aggregate through methods or operations in the aggregate root class.
You should make changes to entities within the aggregate only via the aggregate root. It is the
aggregate’s consistency guardian, considering all the invariants and consistency rules you might need
to comply with in your aggregate. If you change a child entity or value object independently, the
202 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

aggregate root cannot ensure that the aggregate is in a valid state. It would be like a table with a
loose leg. Maintaining consistency is the main purpose of the aggregate root.
In Figure 7-9, you can see sample aggregates like the buyer aggregate, which contains a single entity
(the aggregate root Buyer). The order aggregate contains multiple entities and a value object.
Figure 7-9. Example of aggregates with multiple or single entities
A DDD domain model is composed from aggregates, an aggregate can have just one entity or more,
and can include value objects as well. Note that the Buyer aggregate could have additional child
entities, depending on your domain, as it does in the ordering microservice in the eShopOnContainers
reference application. Figure 7-9 just illustrates a case in which the buyer has a single entity, as an
example of an aggregate that contains only an aggregate root.
In order to maintain separation of aggregates and keep clear boundaries between them, it is a good
practice in a DDD domain model to disallow direct navigation between aggregates and only having
the foreign key (FK) field, as implemented in the Ordering microservice domain model in
eShopOnContainers. The Order entity only has a foreign key field for the buyer, but not an EF Core
navigation property, as shown in the following code:
public class Order : Entity, IAggregateRoot
{
private DateTime _orderDate;
public Address Address { get; private set; }
private int? _buyerId; // FK pointing to a different aggregate root
public OrderStatus OrderStatus { get; private set; }
private readonly List<OrderItem> _orderItems;
public IReadOnlyCollection<OrderItem> OrderItems => _orderItems;
// ... Additional code
}

Implement a microservice domain model with .NET
In the previous section, the fundamental design principles and patterns for designing a domain model
were explained. Now it’s time to explore possible ways to implement the domain model by using .NET
(plain C# code) and EF Core. Your domain model will be composed simply of your code. It will have
just the EF Core model requirements, but not real dependencies on EF. You shouldn’t have hard
dependencies or references to EF Core or any other ORM in your domain model.
Domain model structure in a custom .NET Standard Library
The folder organization used for the eShopOnContainers reference application demonstrates the DDD
model for the application. You might find that a different folder organization more clearly
communicates the design choices made for your application. As you can see in Figure 7-10, in the
ordering domain model there are two aggregates, the order aggregate and the buyer aggregate. Each
aggregate is a group of domain entities and value objects, although you could have an aggregate
composed of a single domain entity (the aggregate root or root entity) as well.
204 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Figure 7-10. Domain model structure for the ordering microservice in eShopOnContainers
Additionally, the domain model layer includes the repository contracts (interfaces) that are the
infrastructure requirements of your domain model. In other words, these interfaces express what
repositories and the methods the infrastructure layer must implement. It’s critical that the
implementation of the repositories be placed outside of the domain model layer, in the infrastructure
layer library, so the domain model layer isn’t “contaminated” by API or classes from infrastructure
technologies, like Entity Framework.
You can also see a SeedWork folder that contains custom base classes that you can use as a base for
your domain entities and value objects, so you don’t have redundant code in each domain’s object
class.
Structure aggregates in a custom .NET Standard library
An aggregate refers to a cluster of domain objects grouped together to match transactional
consistency. Those objects could be instances of entities (one of which is the aggregate root or root
entity) plus any additional value objects.
Transactional consistency means that an aggregate is guaranteed to be consistent and up to date at
the end of a business action. For example, the order aggregate from the eShopOnContainers ordering
microservice domain model is composed as shown in Figure 7-11.
205 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns



---

Figure 7-11. The order aggregate in Visual Studio solution
If you open any of the files in an aggregate folder, you can see how it’s marked as either a custom
base class or interface, like entity or value object, as implemented in the SeedWork folder.
Implement domain entities as POCO classes
You implement a domain model in .NET by creating POCO classes that implement your domain
entities. In the following example, the Order class is defined as an entity and also as an aggregate
root. Because the Order class derives from the Entity base class, it can reuse common code related to
entities. Bear in mind that these base classes and interfaces are defined by you in the domain model
project, so it is your code, not infrastructure code from an ORM like EF.
// COMPATIBLE WITH ENTITY FRAMEWORK CORE 5.0
// Entity is a custom base class with the ID
public class Order : Entity, IAggregateRoot
{
private DateTime _orderDate;
public Address Address { get; private set; }
private int? _buyerId;
public OrderStatus OrderStatus { get; private set; }
private int _orderStatusId;
private string _description;
private int? _paymentMethodId;
private readonly List<OrderItem> _orderItems;
public IReadOnlyCollection<OrderItem> OrderItems => _orderItems;
public Order(string userId, Address address, int cardTypeId, string cardNumber, string
cardSecurityNumber,
string cardHolderName, DateTime cardExpiration, int? buyerId = null, int?
paymentMethodId = null)
{
_orderItems = new List<OrderItem>();
_buyerId = buyerId;
_paymentMethodId = paymentMethodId;
_orderStatusId = OrderStatus.Submitted.Id;
_orderDate = DateTime.UtcNow;
206 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


Address = address;
// ...Additional code ...
}
public void AddOrderItem(int productId, string productName,
decimal unitPrice, decimal discount,
string pictureUrl, int units = 1)
{
//...
// Domain rules/logic for adding the OrderItem to the order
// ...
var orderItem = new OrderItem(productId, productName, unitPrice, discount,
pictureUrl, units);
_orderItems.Add(orderItem);
}
// ...
// Additional methods with domain rules/logic related to the Order aggregate
// ...
}
It’s important to note that this is a domain entity implemented as a POCO class. It doesn’t have any
direct dependency on Entity Framework Core or any other infrastructure framework. This
implementation is as it should be in DDD, just C# code implementing a domain model.
In addition, the class is decorated with an interface named IAggregateRoot. That interface is an empty
interface, sometimes called a marker interface, that’s used just to indicate that this entity class is also
an aggregate root.
A marker interface is sometimes considered as an anti-pattern; however, it’s also a clean way to mark
a class, especially when that interface might be evolving. An attribute could be the other choice for
the marker, but it’s quicker to see the base class (Entity) next to the IAggregate interface instead of
putting an Aggregate attribute marker above the class. It’s a matter of preferences, in any case.
Having an aggregate root means that most of the code related to consistency and business rules of
the aggregate’s entities should be implemented as methods in the Order aggregate root class (for
example, AddOrderItem when adding an OrderItem object to the aggregate). You should not create
or update OrderItems objects independently or directly; the AggregateRoot class must keep control
and consistency of any update operation against its child entities.
Encapsulate data in the Domain Entities
A common problem in entity models is that they expose collection navigation properties as publicly
accessible list types. This allows any collaborator developer to manipulate the contents of these
collection types, which may bypass important business rules related to the collection, possibly leaving
the object in an invalid state. The solution to this is to expose read-only access to related collections
and explicitly provide methods that define ways in which clients can manipulate them.
In the previous code, note that many attributes are read-only or private and are only updatable by the
class methods, so any update considers business domain invariants and logic specified within the class
methods.
207 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

For example, following DDD patterns, you should not do the following from any command handler
method or application layer class (actually, it should be impossible for you to do so):
// WRONG ACCORDING TO DDD PATTERNS – CODE AT THE APPLICATION LAYER OR
// COMMAND HANDLERS
// Code in command handler methods or Web API controllers
//... (WRONG) Some code with business logic out of the domain classes ...
OrderItem myNewOrderItem = new OrderItem(orderId, productId, productName,
pictureUrl, unitPrice, discount, units);
//... (WRONG) Accessing the OrderItems collection directly from the application layer // or
command handlers
myOrder.OrderItems.Add(myNewOrderItem);
//...
In this case, the Add method is purely an operation to add data, with direct access to the OrderItems
collection. Therefore, most of the domain logic, rules, or validations related to that operation with the
child entities will be spread across the application layer (command handlers and Web API controllers).
If you go around the aggregate root, the aggregate root cannot guarantee its invariants, its validity, or
its consistency. Eventually you’ll have spaghetti code or transactional script code.
To follow DDD patterns, entities must not have public setters in any entity property. Changes in an
entity should be driven by explicit methods with explicit ubiquitous language about the change
they’re performing in the entity.
Furthermore, collections within the entity (like the order items) should be read-only properties (the
AsReadOnly method explained later). You should be able to update it only from within the aggregate
root class methods or the child entity methods.
As you can see in the code for the Order aggregate root, all setters should be private or at least read-
only externally, so that any operation against the entity’s data or its child entities has to be performed
through methods in the entity class. This maintains consistency in a controlled and object-oriented
way instead of implementing transactional script code.
The following code snippet shows the proper way to code the task of adding an OrderItem object to
the Order aggregate.
// RIGHT ACCORDING TO DDD--CODE AT THE APPLICATION LAYER OR COMMAND HANDLERS
// The code in command handlers or WebAPI controllers, related only to application stuff
// There is NO code here related to OrderItem object's business logic
myOrder.AddOrderItem(productId, productName, pictureUrl, unitPrice, discount, units);
// The code related to OrderItem params validations or domain rules should
// be WITHIN the AddOrderItem method.
//...
In this snippet, most of the validations or logic related to the creation of an OrderItem object will be
under the control of the Order aggregate root—in the AddOrderItem method—especially validations
and logic related to other elements in the aggregate. For instance, you might get the same product
item as the result of multiple calls to AddOrderItem. In that method, you could examine the product
items and consolidate the same product items into a single OrderItem object with several units.
208 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Additionally, if there are different discount amounts but the product ID is the same, you would likely
apply the higher discount. This principle applies to any other domain logic for the OrderItem object.
In addition, the new OrderItem(params) operation will also be controlled and performed by the
AddOrderItem method from the Order aggregate root. Therefore, most of the logic or validations
related to that operation (especially anything that impacts the consistency between other child
entities) will be in a single place within the aggregate root. That is the ultimate purpose of the
aggregate root pattern.
When you use Entity Framework Core 1.1 or later, a DDD entity can be better expressed because it
allows mapping to fields in addition to properties. This is useful when protecting collections of child
entities or value objects. With this enhancement, you can use simple private fields instead of
properties and you can implement any update to the field collection in public methods and provide
read-only access through the AsReadOnly method.
In DDD, you want to update the entity only through methods in the entity (or the constructor) in order
to control any invariant and the consistency of the data, so properties are defined only with a get
accessor. The properties are backed by private fields. Private members can only be accessed from
within the class. However, there is one exception: EF Core needs to set these fields as well (so it can
return the object with the proper values).
Map properties with only get accessors to the fields in the database table
Mapping properties to database table columns is not a domain responsibility but part of the
infrastructure and persistence layer. We mention this here just so you’re aware of the new capabilities
in EF Core 1.1 or later related to how you can model entities. Additional details on this topic are
explained in the infrastructure and persistence section.
When you use EF Core 1.0 or later, within the DbContext you need to map the properties that are
defined only with getters to the actual fields in the database table. This is done with the HasField
method of the PropertyBuilder class.
Map fields without properties
With the feature in EF Core 1.1 or later to map columns to fields, it’s also possible to not use
properties. Instead, you can just map columns from a table to fields. A common use case for this is
private fields for an internal state that doesn’t need to be accessed from outside the entity.
For example, in the preceding OrderAggregate code example, there are several private fields, like the
_paymentMethodId field, that have no related property for either a setter or getter. That field could
also be calculated within the order’s business logic and used from the order’s methods, but it needs
to be persisted in the database as well. So in EF Core (since v1.1), there’s a way to map a field without
a related property to a column in the database. This is also explained in the Infrastructure layer section
of this guide.

Seedwork (reusable base classes and interfaces for
your domain model)
The solution folder contains a SeedWork folder. This folder contains custom base classes that you can
use as a base for your domain entities and value objects. Use these base classes so you don’t have
redundant code in each domain’s object class. The folder for these types of classes is called SeedWork
and not something like Framework. It’s called SeedWork because the folder contains just a small
subset of reusable classes that cannot really be considered a framework. Seedwork is a term
introduced by Michael Feathers and popularized by Martin Fowler but you could also name that
folder Common, SharedKernel, or similar.
Figure 7-12 shows the classes that form the seedwork of the domain model in the ordering
microservice. It has a few custom base classes like Entity, ValueObject, and Enumeration, plus a few
interfaces. These interfaces (IRepository and IUnitOfWork) inform the infrastructure layer about what
needs to be implemented. Those interfaces are also used through Dependency Injection from the
application layer.
Figure 7-12. A sample set of domain model “seedwork” base classes and interfaces
This is the type of copy and paste reuse that many developers share between projects, not a formal
framework. You can have seedworks in any layer or library. However, if the set of classes and
interfaces gets large enough, you might want to create a single class library.
210 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


The custom Entity base class
The following code is an example of an Entity base class where you can place code that can be used
the same way by any domain entity, such as the entity ID, equality operators, a domain event list per
entity, etc.
// COMPATIBLE WITH ENTITY FRAMEWORK CORE (1.1 and later)
public abstract class Entity
{
int? _requestedHashCode;
int _Id;
private List<INotification> _domainEvents;
public virtual int Id
{
get
{
return _Id;
}
protected set
{
_Id = value;
}
}
public List<INotification> DomainEvents => _domainEvents;
public void AddDomainEvent(INotification eventItem)
{
_domainEvents = _domainEvents ?? new List<INotification>();
_domainEvents.Add(eventItem);
}
public void RemoveDomainEvent(INotification eventItem)
{
if (_domainEvents is null) return;
_domainEvents.Remove(eventItem);
}
public bool IsTransient()
{
return this.Id == default(Int32);
}
public override bool Equals(object obj)
{
if (obj == null || !(obj is Entity))
return false;
if (Object.ReferenceEquals(this, obj))
return true;
if (this.GetType() != obj.GetType())
return false;
Entity item = (Entity)obj;
if (item.IsTransient() || this.IsTransient())
return false;
else
return item.Id == this.Id;
}
public override int GetHashCode()
{
if (!IsTransient())
211 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

{
if (!_requestedHashCode.HasValue)
_requestedHashCode = this.Id.GetHashCode() ^ 31;
// XOR for random distribution. See:
// https://learn.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/ericlippert/guidelines-and-rules-
for-gethashcode
return _requestedHashCode.Value;
}
else
return base.GetHashCode();
}
public static bool operator ==(Entity left, Entity right)
{
if (Object.Equals(left, null))
return (Object.Equals(right, null));
else
return left.Equals(right);
}
public static bool operator !=(Entity left, Entity right)
{
return !(left == right);
}
}
The previous code using a domain event list per entity will be explained in the next sections when
focusing on domain events.
Repository contracts (interfaces) in the domain model layer
Repository contracts are simply .NET interfaces that express the contract requirements of the
repositories to be used for each aggregate.
The repositories themselves, with EF Core code or any other infrastructure dependencies and code
(Linq, SQL, etc.), must not be implemented within the domain model; the repositories should only
implement the interfaces you define in the domain model.
A pattern related to this practice (placing the repository interfaces in the domain model layer) is the
Separated Interface pattern. As explained by Martin Fowler, “Use Separated Interface to define an
interface in one package but implement it in another. This way a client that needs the dependency to
the interface can be completely unaware of the implementation.”
Following the Separated Interface pattern enables the application layer (in this case, the Web API
project for the microservice) to have a dependency on the requirements defined in the domain model,
but not a direct dependency to the infrastructure/persistence layer. In addition, you can use
Dependency Injection to isolate the implementation, which is implemented in the infrastructure/
persistence layer using repositories.
For example, the following example with the IOrderRepository interface defines what operations the
OrderRepository class will need to implement at the infrastructure layer. In the current
implementation of the application, the code just needs to add or update orders to the database, since
queries are split following the simplified CQRS approach.
// Defined at IOrderRepository.cs
public interface IOrderRepository : IRepository<Order>
{
212 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Order Add(Order order);
void Update(Order order);
Task<Order> GetAsync(int orderId);
}
// Defined at IRepository.cs (Part of the Domain Seedwork)
public interface IRepository<T> where T : IAggregateRoot
{
IUnitOfWork UnitOfWork { get; }
}

Implement value objects
As discussed in earlier sections about entities and aggregates, identity is fundamental for entities.
However, there are many objects and data items in a system that do not require an identity and
identity tracking, such as value objects.
A value object can reference other entities. For example, in an application that generates a route that
describes how to get from one point to another, that route would be a value object. It would be a
snapshot of points on a specific route, but this suggested route would not have an identity, even
though internally it might refer to entities like City, Road, etc.
Figure 7-13 shows the Address value object within the Order aggregate.
213 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Figure 7-13. Address value object within the Order aggregate
As shown in Figure 7-13, an entity is usually composed of multiple attributes. For example, the Order
entity can be modeled as an entity with an identity and composed internally of a set of attributes such
as OrderId, OrderDate, OrderItems, etc. But the address, which is simply a complex-value composed of
country/region, street, city, etc., and has no identity in this domain, must be modeled and treated as a
value object.
Important characteristics of value objects
There are two main characteristics for value objects:
• They have no identity.
• They are immutable.
The first characteristic was already discussed. Immutability is an important requirement. The values of
a value object must be immutable once the object is created. Therefore, when the object is
214 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


constructed, you must provide the required values, but you must not allow them to change during the
object’s lifetime.
Value objects allow you to perform certain tricks for performance, thanks to their immutable nature.
This is especially true in systems where there may be thousands of value object instances, many of
which have the same values. Their immutable nature allows them to be reused; they can be
interchangeable objects, since their values are the same and they have no identity. This type of
optimization can sometimes make a difference between software that runs slowly and software with
good performance. Of course, all these cases depend on the application environment and deployment
context.
Value object implementation in C#
In terms of implementation, you can have a value object base class that has basic utility methods like
equality based on the comparison between all the attributes (since a value object must not be based
on identity) and other fundamental characteristics. The following example shows a value object base
class used in the ordering microservice from eShopOnContainers.
public abstract class ValueObject
{
protected static bool EqualOperator(ValueObject left, ValueObject right)
{
if (ReferenceEquals(left, null) ^ ReferenceEquals(right, null))
{
return false;
}
return ReferenceEquals(left, right) || left.Equals(right);
}
protected static bool NotEqualOperator(ValueObject left, ValueObject right)
{
return !(EqualOperator(left, right));
}
protected abstract IEnumerable<object> GetEqualityComponents();
public override bool Equals(object obj)
{
if (obj == null || obj.GetType() != GetType())
{
return false;
}
var other = (ValueObject)obj;
return this.GetEqualityComponents().SequenceEqual(other.GetEqualityComponents());
}
public override int GetHashCode()
{
return GetEqualityComponents()
.Select(x => x != null ? x.GetHashCode() : 0)
.Aggregate((x, y) => x ^ y);
}
// Other utility methods
}
215 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


---

The ValueObject is an abstract class type, but in this example, it doesn’t overload the == and !=
operators. You could choose to do so, making comparisons delegate to the Equals override. For
example, consider the following operator overloads to the ValueObject type:
public static bool operator ==(ValueObject one, ValueObject two)
{
return EqualOperator(one, two);
}
public static bool operator !=(ValueObject one, ValueObject two)
{
return NotEqualOperator(one, two);
}
You can use this class when implementing your actual value object, as with the Address
value object shown in the following example:
public class Address : ValueObject
{
public String Street { get; private set; }
public String City { get; private set; }
public String State { get; private set; }
public String Country { get; private set; }
public String ZipCode { get; private set; }
public Address() { }
public Address(string street, string city, string state, string country, string
zipcode)
{
Street = street;
City = city;
State = state;
Country = country;
ZipCode = zipcode;
}
protected override IEnumerable<object> GetEqualityComponents()
{
// Using a yield return statement to return each element one at a time
yield return Street;
yield return City;
yield return State;
yield return Country;
yield return ZipCode;
}
}
This value object implementation of Address has no identity, and therefore no ID field is defined for it,
either in the Address class definition or the ValueObject class definition.
Having no ID field in a class to be used by Entity Framework (EF) was not possible until EF Core 2.0,
which greatly helps to implement better value objects with no ID. That is precisely the explanation of
the next section.
It could be argued that value objects, being immutable, should be read-only (that is, have get-only
properties), and that’s indeed true. However, value objects are usually serialized and deserialized to go
216 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

through message queues, and being read-only stops the deserializer from assigning values, so you
just leave them as private set, which is read-only enough to be practical.
Value object comparison semantics
Two instances of the Address type can be compared using all the following methods:
var one = new Address("1 Microsoft Way", "Redmond", "WA", "US", "98052");
var two = new Address("1 Microsoft Way", "Redmond", "WA", "US", "98052");
Console.WriteLine(EqualityComparer<Address>.Default.Equals(one, two)); // True
Console.WriteLine(object.Equals(one, two)); // True
Console.WriteLine(one.Equals(two)); // True
Console.WriteLine(one == two); // True
When all the values are the same, the comparisons are correctly evaluated as true. If you didn’t choose
to overload the == and != operators, then the last comparison of one == two would evaluate as false.
For more information, see Overload ValueObject equality operators.
How to persist value objects in the database with EF Core 2.0 and later
You just saw how to define a value object in your domain model. But how can you actually persist it
into the database using Entity Framework Core since it usually targets entities with identity?
Background and older approaches using EF Core 1.1
As background, a limitation when using EF Core 1.0 and 1.1 was that you could not use complex types
as defined in EF 6.x in the traditional .NET Framework. Therefore, if using EF Core 1.0 or 1.1, you
needed to store your value object as an EF entity with an ID field. Then, so it looked more like a value
object with no identity, you could hide its ID so you make clear that the identity of a value object is
not important in the domain model. You could hide that ID by using the ID as a shadow property.
Since that configuration for hiding the ID in the model is set up in the EF infrastructure level, it would
be kind of transparent for your domain model.
In the initial version of eShopOnContainers (.NET Core 1.1), the hidden ID needed by EF Core
infrastructure was implemented in the following way in the DbContext level, using Fluent API at the
infrastructure project. Therefore, the ID was hidden from the domain model point of view, but still
present in the infrastructure.
// Old approach with EF Core 1.1
// Fluent API within the OrderingContext:DbContext in the Infrastructure project
void ConfigureAddress(EntityTypeBuilder<Address> addressConfiguration)
{
addressConfiguration.ToTable("address", DEFAULT_SCHEMA);
addressConfiguration.Property<int>("Id") // Id is a shadow property
.IsRequired();
addressConfiguration.HasKey("Id"); // Id is a shadow property
}
However, the persistence of that value object into the database was performed like a regular entity in
a different table.
217 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

With EF Core 2.0 and later, there are new and better ways to persist value objects.
Persist value objects as owned entity types in EF Core 2.0 and later
Even with some gaps between the canonical value object pattern in DDD and the owned entity type in
EF Core, it’s currently the best way to persist value objects with EF Core 2.0 and later. You can see
limitations at the end of this section.
The owned entity type feature was added to EF Core since version 2.0.
An owned entity type allows you to map types that do not have their own identity explicitly defined in
the domain model and are used as properties, such as a value object, within any of your entities. An
owned entity type shares the same CLR type with another entity type (that is, it’s just a regular class).
The entity containing the defining navigation is the owner entity. When querying the owner, the
owned types are included by default.
Just by looking at the domain model, an owned type looks like it doesn’t have any identity. However,
under the covers, owned types do have the identity, but the owner navigation property is part of this
identity.
The identity of instances of owned types is not completely their own. It consists of three components:
• The identity of the owner
• The navigation property pointing to them
• In the case of collections of owned types, an independent component (supported in EF Core
2.2 and later).
For example, in the Ordering domain model at eShopOnContainers, as part of the Order entity, the
Address value object is implemented as an owned entity type within the owner entity, which is the
Order entity. Address is a type with no identity property defined in the domain model. It is used as a
property of the Order type to specify the shipping address for a particular order.
By convention, a shadow primary key is created for the owned type and it will be mapped to the same
table as the owner by using table splitting. This allows to use owned types similarly to how complex
types are used in EF6 in the traditional .NET Framework.
It is important to note that owned types are never discovered by convention in EF Core, so you have
to declare them explicitly.
In eShopOnContainers, in the OrderingContext.cs file, within the OnModelCreating() method, multiple
infrastructure configurations are applied. One of them is related to the Order entity.
// Part of the OrderingContext.cs class at the Ordering.Infrastructure project
//
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
modelBuilder.ApplyConfiguration(new ClientRequestEntityTypeConfiguration());
modelBuilder.ApplyConfiguration(new PaymentMethodEntityTypeConfiguration());
modelBuilder.ApplyConfiguration(new OrderEntityTypeConfiguration());
modelBuilder.ApplyConfiguration(new OrderItemEntityTypeConfiguration());
//...Additional type configurations
}
218 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

In the following code, the persistence infrastructure is defined for the Order entity:
// Part of the OrderEntityTypeConfiguration.cs class
//
public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Order> orderConfiguration)
{
orderConfiguration.ToTable("orders", OrderingContext.DEFAULT_SCHEMA);
orderConfiguration.HasKey(o => o.Id);
orderConfiguration.Ignore(b => b.DomainEvents);
orderConfiguration.Property(o => o.Id)
.ForSqlServerUseSequenceHiLo("orderseq", OrderingContext.DEFAULT_SCHEMA);
//Address value object persisted as owned entity in EF Core 2.0
orderConfiguration.OwnsOne(o => o.Address);
orderConfiguration.Property<DateTime>("OrderDate").IsRequired();
//...Additional validations, constraints and code...
//...
}
In the previous code, the orderConfiguration.OwnsOne(o => o.Address) method specifies that the
Address property is an owned entity of the Order type.
By default, EF Core conventions name the database columns for the properties of the owned entity
type as EntityProperty_OwnedEntityProperty. Therefore, the internal properties of Address will appear
in the Orders table with the names Address_Street, Address_City (and so on for State, Country, and
ZipCode).
You can append the Property().HasColumnName() fluent method to rename those columns. In the
case where Address is a public property, the mappings would be like the following:
orderConfiguration.OwnsOne(p => p.Address)
.Property(p=>p.Street).HasColumnName("ShippingStreet");
orderConfiguration.OwnsOne(p => p.Address)
.Property(p=>p.City).HasColumnName("ShippingCity");
It’s possible to chain the OwnsOne method in a fluent mapping. In the following hypothetical
example, OrderDetails owns BillingAddress and ShippingAddress, which are both Address types. Then
OrderDetails is owned by the Order type.
orderConfiguration.OwnsOne(p => p.OrderDetails, cb =>
{
cb.OwnsOne(c => c.BillingAddress);
cb.OwnsOne(c => c.ShippingAddress);
});
//...
//...
public class Order
{
public int Id { get; set; }
public OrderDetails OrderDetails { get; set; }
}
public class OrderDetails
{
public Address BillingAddress { get; set; }
219 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

public Address ShippingAddress { get; set; }
}
public class Address
{
public string Street { get; set; }
public string City { get; set; }
}
Additional details on owned entity types
• Owned types are defined when you configure a navigation property to a particular type using
the OwnsOne fluent API.
• The definition of an owned type in our metadata model is a composite of: the owner type, the
navigation property, and the CLR type of the owned type.
• The identity (key) of an owned type instance in our stack is a composite of the identity of the
owner type and the definition of the owned type.
Owned entities capabilities
• Owned types can reference other entities, either owned (nested owned types) or non-owned
(regular reference navigation properties to other entities).
• You can map the same CLR type as different owned types in the same owner entity through
separate navigation properties.
• Table splitting is set up by convention, but you can opt out by mapping the owned type to a
different table using ToTable.
• Eager loading is performed automatically on owned types, that is, there’s no need to call
.Include() on the query.
• Can be configured with attribute [Owned], using EF Core 2.1 and later.
• Can handle collections of owned types (using version 2.2 and later).
Owned entities limitations
• You can’t create a DbSet<T> of an owned type (by design).
• You can’t call ModelBuilder.Entity<T>() on owned types (currently by design).
• No support for optional (that is, nullable) owned types that are mapped with the owner in the
same table (that is, using table splitting). This is because mapping is done for each property,
there is no separate sentinel for the null complex value as a whole.
• No inheritance-mapping support for owned types, but you should be able to map two leaf
types of the same inheritance hierarchies as different owned types. EF Core will not reason
about the fact that they are part of the same hierarchy.
220 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Main differences with EF6’s complex types
• Table splitting is optional, that is, they can optionally be mapped to a separate table and still
be owned types.

Use enumeration classes instead of enum types
Enumerations (or enum types for short) are a thin language wrapper around an integral type. You
might want to limit their use to when you are storing one value from a closed set of values.
Classification based on sizes (small, medium, large) is a good example. Using enums for control flow
or more robust abstractions can be a code smell. This type of usage leads to fragile code with many
control flow statements checking values of the enum.
221 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Instead, you can create Enumeration classes that enable all the rich features of an object-oriented
language.
However, this isn’t a critical topic and in many cases, for simplicity, you can still use regular enum
types if that’s your preference. The use of enumeration classes is more related to business-related
concepts.
Implement an Enumeration base class
The ordering microservice in eShopOnContainers provides a sample Enumeration base class
implementation, as shown in the following example:
public abstract class Enumeration : IComparable
{
public string Name { get; private set; }
public int Id { get; private set; }
protected Enumeration(int id, string name) => (Id, Name) = (id, name);
public override string ToString() => Name;
public static IEnumerable<T> GetAll<T>() where T : Enumeration =>
typeof(T).GetFields(BindingFlags.Public |
BindingFlags.Static |
BindingFlags.DeclaredOnly)
.Select(f => f.GetValue(null))
.Cast<T>();
public override bool Equals(object obj)
{
if (obj is not Enumeration otherValue)
{
return false;
}
var typeMatches = GetType().Equals(obj.GetType());
var valueMatches = Id.Equals(otherValue.Id);
return typeMatches && valueMatches;
}
public int CompareTo(object other) => Id.CompareTo(((Enumeration)other).Id);
// Other utility methods ...
}
You can use this class as a type in any entity or value object, as for the following
CardType : Enumeration class:
public class CardType
: Enumeration
{
public static CardType Amex = new(1, nameof(Amex));
public static CardType Visa = new(2, nameof(Visa));
public static CardType MasterCard = new(3, nameof(MasterCard));
public CardType(int id, string name)
: base(id, name)
{

Design validations in the domain model layer
In DDD, validation rules can be thought as invariants. The main responsibility of an aggregate is to
enforce invariants across state changes for all the entities within that aggregate.
Domain entities should always be valid entities. There are a certain number of invariants for an object
that should always be true. For example, an order item object always has to have a quantity that must
be a positive integer, plus an article name and price. Therefore, invariants enforcement is the
responsibility of the domain entities (especially of the aggregate root) and an entity object should not
be able to exist without being valid. Invariant rules are simply expressed as contracts, and exceptions
or notifications are raised when they are violated.
The reasoning behind this is that many bugs occur because objects are in a state they should never
have been in.
Let’s propose we now have a SendUserCreationEmailService that takes a UserProfile … how can we
rationalize in that service that Name is not null? Do we check it again? Or more likely … you just don’t
bother to check and “hope for the best”—you hope that someone bothered to validate it before
sending it to you. Of course, using TDD one of the first tests we should be writing is that if I send a
customer with a null name that it should raise an error. But once we start writing these kinds of tests
over and over again we realize … “what if we never allowed name to become null? we wouldn’t have
all of these tests!”.
223 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Implement validations in the domain model layer
Validations are usually implemented in domain entity constructors or in methods that can update the
entity. There are multiple ways to implement validations, such as verifying data and raising exceptions
if the validation fails. There are also more advanced patterns such as using the Specification pattern
for validations, and the Notification pattern to return a collection of errors instead of returning an
exception for each validation as it occurs.
Validate conditions and throw exceptions
The following code example shows the simplest approach to validation in a domain entity by raising
an exception. In the references table at the end of this section you can see links to more advanced
implementations based on the patterns we have discussed previously.
public void SetAddress(Address address)
{
_shippingAddress = address?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(address));
}
A better example would demonstrate the need to ensure that either the internal state did
not change, or that all the mutations for a method occurred. For example, the following
implementation would leave the object in an invalid state:
public void SetAddress(string line1, string line2,
string city, string state, int zip)
{
_shippingAddress.line1 = line1 ?? throw new ...
_shippingAddress.line2 = line2;
_shippingAddress.city = city ?? throw new ...
_shippingAddress.state = (IsValid(state) ? state : throw new …);
}
If the value of the state is invalid, the first address line and the city have already been changed. That
might make the address invalid.
A similar approach can be used in the entity’s constructor, raising an exception to make sure that the
entity is valid once it is created.
Use validation attributes in the model based on data annotations
Data annotations, like the Required or MaxLength attributes, can be used to configure EF Core
database field properties, as explained in detail in the Table mapping section, but they no longer work
for entity validation in EF Core (neither does the IValidatableObject.Validate method), as they have
done since EF 4.x in .NET Framework.
Data annotations and the IValidatableObject interface can still be used for model validation during
model binding, prior to the controller’s actions invocation as usual, but that model is meant to be a
ViewModel or DTO and that’s an MVC or API concern not a domain model concern.
Having made the conceptual difference clear, you can still use data annotations and
IValidatableObject in the entity class for validation, if your actions receive an entity class object
parameter, which is not recommended. In that case, validation will occur upon model binding, just
before invoking the action and you can check the controller’s ModelState.IsValid property to check
224 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

the result, but then again, it happens in the controller, not before persisting the entity object in the
DbContext, as it had done since EF 4.x.
You can still implement custom validation in the entity class using data annotations and the
IValidatableObject.Validate method, by overriding the DbContext’s SaveChanges method.
You can see a sample implementation for validating IValidatableObject entities in this comment on
GitHub. That sample doesn’t do attribute-based validations, but they should be easy to implement
using reflection in the same override.
However, from a DDD point of view, the domain model is best kept lean with the use of exceptions in
your entity’s behavior methods, or by implementing the Specification and Notification patterns to
enforce validation rules.
It can make sense to use data annotations at the application layer in ViewModel classes (instead of
domain entities) that will accept input, to allow for model validation within the UI layer. However, this
should not be done at the exclusion of validation within the domain model.
Validate entities by implementing the Specification pattern and the Notification
pattern
Finally, a more elaborate approach to implementing validations in the domain model is by
implementing the Specification pattern in conjunction with the Notification pattern, as explained in
some of the additional resources listed later.
It is worth mentioning that you can also use just one of those patterns—for example, validating
manually with control statements, but using the Notification pattern to stack and return a list of
validation errors.
Use deferred validation in the domain
There are various approaches to deal with deferred validations in the domain. In his book
Implementing Domain-Driven Design, Vaughn Vernon discusses these in the section on validation.
Two-step validation
Also consider two-step validation. Use field-level validation on your command Data Transfer Objects
(DTOs) and domain-level validation inside your entities. You can do this by returning a result object
instead of exceptions in order to make it easier to deal with the validation errors.
Using field validation with data annotations, for example, you do not duplicate the validation
definition. The execution, though, can be both server-side and client-side in the case of DTOs
(commands and ViewModels, for instance).

Client-side validation (validation in the presentation
layers)
Even when the source of truth is the domain model and ultimately you must have validation at the
domain model level, validation can still be handled at both the domain model level (server side) and
the UI (client side).
Client-side validation is a great convenience for users. It saves time they would otherwise spend
waiting for a round trip to the server that might return validation errors. In business terms, even a few
fractions of seconds multiplied hundreds of times each day adds up to a lot of time, expense, and
frustration. Straightforward and immediate validation enables users to work more efficiently and
produce better quality input and output.
Just as the view model and the domain model are different, view model validation and domain model
validation might be similar but serve a different purpose. If you are concerned about DRY (the Don’t
Repeat Yourself principle), consider that in this case code reuse might also mean coupling, and in
enterprise applications it is more important not to couple the server side to the client side than to
follow the DRY principle.
Even when using client-side validation, you should always validate your commands or input DTOs in
server code, because the server APIs are a possible attack vector. Usually, doing both is your best bet
because if you have a client application, from a UX perspective, it is best to be proactive and not allow
the user to enter invalid information.
Therefore, in client-side code you typically validate the ViewModels. You could also validate the client
output DTOs or commands before you send them to the services.
The implementation of client-side validation depends on what kind of client application you are
building. It will be different if you are validating data in a web MVC web application with most of the
code in .NET, a SPA web application with that validation being coded in JavaScript or TypeScript, or a
mobile app coded with Xamarin and C#.

In summary, these are the most important concepts in regards to validation:
• Entities and aggregates should enforce their own consistency and be “always valid”.
Aggregate roots are responsible for multi-entity consistency within the same aggregate.
• If you think that an entity needs to enter an invalid state, consider using a different object
model—for example, using a temporary DTO until you create the final domain entity.
• If you need to create several related objects, such as an aggregate, and they are only valid
once all of them have been created, consider using the Factory pattern.
• In most of the cases, having redundant validation in the client side is good, because the
application can be proactive.
Domain events: Design and implementation
Use domain events to explicitly implement side effects of changes within your domain. In other words,
and using DDD terminology, use domain events to explicitly implement side effects across multiple
aggregates. Optionally, for better scalability and less impact in database locks, use eventual
consistency between aggregates within the same domain.
227 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

What is a domain event?
An event is something that has happened in the past. A domain event is, something that happened in
the domain that you want other parts of the same domain (in-process) to be aware of. The notified
parts usually react somehow to the events.
An important benefit of domain events is that side effects can be expressed explicitly.
For example, if you’re just using Entity Framework and there has to be a reaction to some event, you
would probably code whatever you need close to what triggers the event. So the rule gets coupled,
implicitly, to the code, and you have to look into the code to, hopefully, realize the rule is
implemented there.
On the other hand, using domain events makes the concept explicit, because there’s a DomainEvent
and at least one DomainEventHandler involved.
For example, in the eShopOnContainers application, when an order is created, the user becomes a
buyer, so an OrderStartedDomainEvent is raised and handled in the
ValidateOrAddBuyerAggregateWhenOrderStartedDomainEventHandler, so the underlying concept is
evident.
In short, domain events help you to express, explicitly, the domain rules, based in the ubiquitous
language provided by the domain experts. Domain events also enable a better separation of concerns
among classes within the same domain.
It’s important to ensure that, just like a database transaction, either all the operations related to a
domain event finish successfully or none of them do.
Domain events are similar to messaging-style events, with one important difference. With real
messaging, message queuing, message brokers, or a service bus using AMQP, a message is always
sent asynchronously and communicated across processes and machines. This is useful for integrating
multiple Bounded Contexts, microservices, or even different applications. However, with domain
events, you want to raise an event from the domain operation you’re currently running, but you want
any side effects to occur within the same domain.
The domain events and their side effects (the actions triggered afterwards that are managed by event
handlers) should occur almost immediately, usually in-process, and within the same domain. Thus,
domain events could be synchronous or asynchronous. Integration events, however, should always be
asynchronous.
Domain events versus integration events
Semantically, domain and integration events are the same thing: notifications about something that
just happened. However, their implementation must be different. Domain events are just messages
pushed to a domain event dispatcher, which could be implemented as an in-memory mediator based
on an IoC container or any other method.
On the other hand, the purpose of integration events is to propagate committed transactions and
updates to additional subsystems, whether they are other microservices, Bounded Contexts or even
228 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

external applications. Hence, they should occur only if the entity is successfully persisted, otherwise it’s
as if the entire operation never happened.
As mentioned before, integration events must be based on asynchronous communication between
multiple microservices (other Bounded Contexts) or even external systems/applications.
Thus, the event bus interface needs some infrastructure that allows inter-process and distributed
communication between potentially remote services. It can be based on a commercial service bus,
queues, a shared database used as a mailbox, or any other distributed and ideally push based
messaging system.
Domain events as a preferred way to trigger side effects across
multiple aggregates within the same domain
If executing a command related to one aggregate instance requires additional domain rules to be run
on one or more additional aggregates, you should design and implement those side effects to be
triggered by domain events. As shown in Figure 7-14, and as one of the most important use cases, a
domain event should be used to propagate state changes across multiple aggregates within the same
domain model.
Figure 7-14. Domain events to enforce consistency between multiple aggregates within the same domain
Figure 7-14 shows how consistency between aggregates is achieved by domain events. When the user
initiates an order, the Order Aggregate sends an OrderStarted domain event. The OrderStarted
domain event is handled by the Buyer Aggregate to create a Buyer object in the ordering
microservice, based on the original user info from the identity microservice (with information provided
in the CreateOrder command).
Alternately, you can have the aggregate root subscribed for events raised by members of its
aggregates (child entities). For instance, each OrderItem child entity can raise an event when the item
price is higher than a specific amount, or when the product item amount is too high. The aggregate
root can then receive those events and perform a global calculation or aggregation.
229 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


It’s important to understand that this event-based communication is not implemented directly within
the aggregates; you need to implement domain event handlers.
Handling the domain events is an application concern. The domain model layer should only focus on
the domain logic—things that a domain expert would understand, not application infrastructure like
handlers and side-effect persistence actions using repositories. Therefore, the application layer level is
where you should have domain event handlers triggering actions when a domain event is raised.
Domain events can also be used to trigger any number of application actions, and what is more
important, must be open to increase that number in the future in a decoupled way. For instance, when
the order is started, you might want to publish a domain event to propagate that info to other
aggregates or even to raise application actions like notifications.
The key point is the open number of actions to be executed when a domain event occurs. Eventually,
the actions and rules in the domain and application will grow. The complexity or number of side-
effect actions when something happens will grow, but if your code were coupled with “glue” (that is,
creating specific objects with new), then every time you needed to add a new action you would also
need to change working and tested code.
This change could result in new bugs and this approach also goes against the Open/Closed principle
from SOLID. Not only that, the original class that was orchestrating the operations would grow and
grow, which goes against the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
On the other hand, if you use domain events, you can create a fine-grained and decoupled
implementation by segregating responsibilities using this approach:
1. Send a command (for example, CreateOrder).
2. Receive the command in a command handler.
– Execute a single aggregate’s transaction.
– (Optional) Raise domain events for side effects (for example,
OrderStartedDomainEvent).
3. Handle domain events (within the current process) that will execute an open number of side
effects in multiple aggregates or application actions. For example:
– Verify or create buyer and payment method.
– Create and send a related integration event to the event bus to propagate states
across microservices or trigger external actions like sending an email to the buyer.
– Handle other side effects.
As shown in Figure 7-15, starting from the same domain event, you can handle multiple actions
related to other aggregates in the domain or additional application actions you need to perform
across microservices connecting with integration events and the event bus.
230 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Figure 7-15. Handling multiple actions per domain
There can be several handlers for the same domain event in the Application Layer, one handler can
solve consistency between aggregates and another handler can publish an integration event, so other
microservices can do something with it. The event handlers are typically in the application layer,
because you’ll use infrastructure objects like repositories or an application API for the microservice’s
behavior. In that sense, event handlers are similar to command handlers, so both are part of the
application layer. The important difference is that a command should be processed only once. A
domain event could be processed zero or n times, because it can be received by multiple receivers or
event handlers with a different purpose for each handler.
Having an open number of handlers per domain event allows you to add as many domain rules as
needed, without affecting current code. For instance, implementing the following business rule might
be as easy as adding a few event handlers (or even just one):
When the total amount purchased by a customer in the store, across any number of orders, exceeds
$6,000, apply a 10% off discount to every new order and notify the customer with an email about that
discount for future orders.
Implement domain events
In C#, a domain event is simply a data-holding structure or class, like a DTO, with all the information
related to what just happened in the domain, as shown in the following example:
public class OrderStartedDomainEvent : INotification
{
public string UserId { get; }
public string UserName { get; }
public int CardTypeId { get; }
public string CardNumber { get; }
public string CardSecurityNumber { get; }
231 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


public string CardHolderName { get; }
public DateTime CardExpiration { get; }
public Order Order { get; }
public OrderStartedDomainEvent(Order order, string userId, string userName,
int cardTypeId, string cardNumber,
string cardSecurityNumber, string cardHolderName,
DateTime cardExpiration)
{
Order = order;
UserId = userId;
UserName = userName;
CardTypeId = cardTypeId;
CardNumber = cardNumber;
CardSecurityNumber = cardSecurityNumber;
CardHolderName = cardHolderName;
CardExpiration = cardExpiration;
}
}
This is essentially a class that holds all the data related to the OrderStarted event.
In terms of the ubiquitous language of the domain, since an event is something that happened in the
past, the class name of the event should be represented as a past-tense verb, like
OrderStartedDomainEvent or OrderShippedDomainEvent. That’s how the domain event is
implemented in the ordering microservice in eShopOnContainers.
As noted earlier, an important characteristic of events is that since an event is something that
happened in the past, it shouldn’t change. Therefore, it must be an immutable class. You can see in
the previous code that the properties are read-only. There’s no way to update the object, you can only
set values when you create it.
It’s important to highlight here that if domain events were to be handled asynchronously, using a
queue that required serializing and deserializing the event objects, the properties would have to be
“private set” instead of read-only, so the deserializer would be able to assign the values upon
dequeuing. This is not an issue in the Ordering microservice, as the domain event pub/sub is
implemented synchronously using MediatR.
Raise domain events
The next question is how to raise a domain event so it reaches its related event handlers. You can use
multiple approaches.
Udi Dahan originally proposed (for example, in several related posts, such as Domain Events – Take 2)
using a static class for managing and raising the events. This might include a static class named
DomainEvents that would raise domain events immediately when it’s called, using syntax like
DomainEvents.Raise(Event myEvent). Jimmy Bogard wrote a blog post (Strengthening your domain:
Domain Events) that recommends a similar approach.
However, when the domain events class is static, it also dispatches to handlers immediately. This
makes testing and debugging more difficult, because the event handlers with side-effects logic are
executed immediately after the event is raised. When you’re testing and debugging, you just want to
focus on what is happening in the current aggregate classes; you don’t want to suddenly be
232 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

redirected to other event handlers for side effects related to other aggregates or application logic.
This is why other approaches have evolved, as explained in the next section.
The deferred approach to raise and dispatch events
Instead of dispatching to a domain event handler immediately, a better approach is to add the
domain events to a collection and then to dispatch those domain events right before or right after
committing the transaction (as with SaveChanges in EF). (This approach was described by Jimmy
Bogard in this post A better domain events pattern.)
Deciding if you send the domain events right before or right after committing the transaction is
important, since it determines whether you will include the side effects as part of the same transaction
or in different transactions. In the latter case, you need to deal with eventual consistency across
multiple aggregates. This topic is discussed in the next section.
The deferred approach is what eShopOnContainers uses. First, you add the events happening in your
entities into a collection or list of events per entity. That list should be part of the entity object, or
even better, part of your base entity class, as shown in the following example of the Entity base class:
public abstract class Entity
{
//...
private List<INotification> _domainEvents;
public List<INotification> DomainEvents => _domainEvents;
public void AddDomainEvent(INotification eventItem)
{
_domainEvents = _domainEvents ?? new List<INotification>();
_domainEvents.Add(eventItem);
}
public void RemoveDomainEvent(INotification eventItem)
{
_domainEvents?.Remove(eventItem);
}
//... Additional code
}
When you want to raise an event, you just add it to the event collection from code at any method of
the aggregate-root entity.
The following code, part of the Order aggregate-root at eShopOnContainers, shows an example:
var orderStartedDomainEvent = new OrderStartedDomainEvent(this, //Order object
cardTypeId, cardNumber,
cardSecurityNumber,
cardHolderName,
cardExpiration);
this.AddDomainEvent(orderStartedDomainEvent);
Notice that the only thing that the AddDomainEvent method is doing is adding an event to the list.
No event is dispatched yet, and no event handler is invoked yet.
233 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

You actually want to dispatch the events later on, when you commit the transaction to the database. If
you are using Entity Framework Core, that means in the SaveChanges method of your EF DbContext,
as in the following code:
// EF Core DbContext
public class OrderingContext : DbContext, IUnitOfWork
{
// ...
public async Task<bool> SaveEntitiesAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken =
default(CancellationToken))
{
// Dispatch Domain Events collection.
// Choices:
// A) Right BEFORE committing data (EF SaveChanges) into the DB. This makes
// a single transaction including side effects from the domain event
// handlers that are using the same DbContext with Scope lifetime
// B) Right AFTER committing data (EF SaveChanges) into the DB. This makes
// multiple transactions. You will need to handle eventual consistency and
// compensatory actions in case of failures.
await _mediator.DispatchDomainEventsAsync(this);
// After this line runs, all the changes (from the Command Handler and Domain
// event handlers) performed through the DbContext will be committed
var result = await base.SaveChangesAsync();
}
}
With this code, you dispatch the entity events to their respective event handlers.
The overall result is that you’ve decoupled the raising of a domain event (a simple add into a list in
memory) from dispatching it to an event handler. In addition, depending on what kind of dispatcher
you are using, you could dispatch the events synchronously or asynchronously.
Be aware that transactional boundaries come into significant play here. If your unit of work and
transaction can span more than one aggregate (as when using EF Core and a relational database), this
can work well. But if the transaction cannot span aggregates, you have to implement additional steps
to achieve consistency. This is another reason why persistence ignorance is not universal; it depends
on the storage system you use.
Single transaction across aggregates versus eventual consistency across
aggregates
The question of whether to perform a single transaction across aggregates versus relying on eventual
consistency across those aggregates is a controversial one. Many DDD authors like Eric Evans and
Vaughn Vernon advocate the rule that one transaction = one aggregate and therefore argue for
eventual consistency across aggregates. For example, in his book Domain-Driven Design, Eric Evans
says this:
Any rule that spans Aggregates will not be expected to be up-to-date at all times. Through event
processing, batch processing, or other update mechanisms, other dependencies can be resolved
within some specific time. (page 128)
Vaughn Vernon says the following in Effective Aggregate Design. Part II: Making Aggregates Work
Together:
234 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Thus, if executing a command on one aggregate instance requires that additional business rules
execute on one or more aggregates, use eventual consistency […] There is a practical way to support
eventual consistency in a DDD model. An aggregate method publishes a domain event that is in time
delivered to one or more asynchronous subscribers.
This rationale is based on embracing fine-grained transactions instead of transactions spanning many
aggregates or entities. The idea is that in the second case, the number of database locks will be
substantial in large-scale applications with high scalability needs. Embracing the fact that highly
scalable applications need not have instant transactional consistency between multiple aggregates
helps with accepting the concept of eventual consistency. Atomic changes are often not needed by
the business, and it is in any case the responsibility of the domain experts to say whether particular
operations need atomic transactions or not. If an operation always needs an atomic transaction
between multiple aggregates, you might ask whether your aggregate should be larger or wasn’t
correctly designed.
However, other developers and architects like Jimmy Bogard are okay with spanning a single
transaction across several aggregates—but only when those additional aggregates are related to side
effects for the same original command. For instance, in A better domain events pattern, Bogard says
this:
Typically, I want the side effects of a domain event to occur within the same logical transaction, but
not necessarily in the same scope of raising the domain event […] Just before we commit our
transaction, we dispatch our events to their respective handlers.
If you dispatch the domain events right before committing the original transaction, it is because you
want the side effects of those events to be included in the same transaction. For example, if the EF
DbContext SaveChanges method fails, the transaction will roll back all changes, including the result of
any side effect operations implemented by the related domain event handlers. This is because the
DbContext life scope is by default defined as “scoped.” Therefore, the DbContext object is shared
across multiple repository objects being instantiated within the same scope or object graph. This
coincides with the HttpRequest scope when developing Web API or MVC apps.
Actually, both approaches (single atomic transaction and eventual consistency) can be right. It really
depends on your domain or business requirements and what the domain experts tell you. It also
depends on how scalable you need the service to be (more granular transactions have less impact
with regard to database locks). And it depends on how much investment you’re willing to make in
your code, since eventual consistency requires more complex code in order to detect possible
inconsistencies across aggregates and the need to implement compensatory actions. Consider that if
you commit changes to the original aggregate and afterwards, when the events are being dispatched,
if there’s an issue and the event handlers cannot commit their side effects, you’ll have inconsistencies
between aggregates.
A way to allow compensatory actions would be to store the domain events in additional database
tables so they can be part of the original transaction. Afterwards, you could have a batch process that
detects inconsistencies and runs compensatory actions by comparing the list of events with the
current state of the aggregates. The compensatory actions are part of a complex topic that will require
deep analysis from your side, which includes discussing it with the business user and domain experts.
235 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


---

In any case, you can choose the approach you need. But the initial deferred approach—raising the
events before committing, so you use a single transaction—is the simplest approach when using EF
Core and a relational database. It’s easier to implement and valid in many business cases. It’s also the
approach used in the ordering microservice in eShopOnContainers.
But how do you actually dispatch those events to their respective event handlers? What’s the
_mediator object you see in the previous example? It has to do with the techniques and artifacts you
use to map between events and their event handlers.
The domain event dispatcher: mapping from events to event handlers
Once you’re able to dispatch or publish the events, you need some kind of artifact that will publish the
event, so that every related handler can get it and process side effects based on that event.
One approach is a real messaging system or even an event bus, possibly based on a service bus as
opposed to in-memory events. However, for the first case, real messaging would be overkill for
processing domain events, since you just need to process those events within the same process (that
is, within the same domain and application layer).
How to subscribe to domain events
When you use MediatR, each event handler must use an event type that is provided on the generic
parameter of the INotificationHandler interface, as you can see in the following code:
public class ValidateOrAddBuyerAggregateWhenOrderStartedDomainEventHandler
: INotificationHandler<OrderStartedDomainEvent>
Based on the relationship between event and event handler, which can be considered the
subscription, the MediatR artifact can discover all the event handlers for each event and trigger each
one of those event handlers.
How to handle domain events
Finally, the event handler usually implements application layer code that uses infrastructure
repositories to obtain the required additional aggregates and to execute side-effect domain logic. The
following domain event handler code at eShopOnContainers, shows an implementation example.
public class ValidateOrAddBuyerAggregateWhenOrderStartedDomainEventHandler
: INotificationHandler<OrderStartedDomainEvent>
{
private readonly ILogger _logger;
private readonly IBuyerRepository _buyerRepository;
private readonly IOrderingIntegrationEventService _orderingIntegrationEventService;
public ValidateOrAddBuyerAggregateWhenOrderStartedDomainEventHandler(
ILogger<ValidateOrAddBuyerAggregateWhenOrderStartedDomainEventHandler> logger,
IBuyerRepository buyerRepository,
IOrderingIntegrationEventService orderingIntegrationEventService)
{
_buyerRepository = buyerRepository ?? throw new
ArgumentNullException(nameof(buyerRepository));
_orderingIntegrationEventService = orderingIntegrationEventService ?? throw new
ArgumentNullException(nameof(orderingIntegrationEventService));
236 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

_logger = logger ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(logger));
}
public async Task Handle(
OrderStartedDomainEvent domainEvent, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
var cardTypeId = domainEvent.CardTypeId != 0 ? domainEvent.CardTypeId : 1;
var buyer = await _buyerRepository.FindAsync(domainEvent.UserId);
var buyerExisted = buyer is not null;
if (!buyerExisted)
{
buyer = new Buyer(domainEvent.UserId, domainEvent.UserName);
}
buyer.VerifyOrAddPaymentMethod(
cardTypeId,
$"Payment Method on {DateTime.UtcNow}",
domainEvent.CardNumber,
domainEvent.CardSecurityNumber,
domainEvent.CardHolderName,
domainEvent.CardExpiration,
domainEvent.Order.Id);
var buyerUpdated = buyerExisted ?
_buyerRepository.Update(buyer) :
_buyerRepository.Add(buyer);
await _buyerRepository.UnitOfWork
.SaveEntitiesAsync(cancellationToken);
var integrationEvent = new OrderStatusChangedToSubmittedIntegrationEvent(
domainEvent.Order.Id, domainEvent.Order.OrderStatus.Name, buyer.Name);
await _orderingIntegrationEventService.AddAndSaveEventAsync(integrationEvent);
OrderingApiTrace.LogOrderBuyerAndPaymentValidatedOrUpdated(
_logger, buyerUpdated.Id, domainEvent.Order.Id);
}
}
The previous domain event handler code is considered application layer code because it uses
infrastructure repositories, as explained in the next section on the infrastructure-persistence layer.
Event handlers could also use other infrastructure components.
Domain events can generate integration events to be published outside of the
microservice boundaries
Finally, it’s important to mention that you might sometimes want to propagate events across multiple
microservices. That propagation is an integration event, and it could be published through an event
bus from any specific domain event handler.
Conclusions on domain events
As stated, use domain events to explicitly implement side effects of changes within your domain. To
use DDD terminology, use domain events to explicitly implement side effects across one or multiple
aggregates. Additionally, and for better scalability and less impact on database locks, use eventual
consistency between aggregates within the same domain.
237 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

The reference app uses MediatR to propagate domain events synchronously across aggregates, within
a single transaction. However, you could also use some AMQP implementation like RabbitMQ or
Azure Service Bus to propagate domain events asynchronously, using eventual consistency but, as
mentioned above, you have to consider the need for compensatory actions in case of failures.

Design the infrastructure persistence layer
Data persistence components provide access to the data hosted within the boundaries of a
microservice (that is, a microservice’s database). They contain the actual implementation of
components such as repositories and Unit of Work classes, like custom Entity Framework (EF)
DbContext objects. EF DbContext implements both the Repository and the Unit of Work patterns.
The Repository pattern
The Repository pattern is a Domain-Driven Design pattern intended to keep persistence concerns
outside of the system’s domain model. One or more persistence abstractions - interfaces - are defined
238 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

in the domain model, and these abstractions have implementations in the form of persistence-specific
adapters defined elsewhere in the application.
Repository implementations are classes that encapsulate the logic required to access data sources.
They centralize common data access functionality, providing better maintainability and decoupling
the infrastructure or technology used to access databases from the domain model. If you use an
Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like Entity Framework, the code that must be implemented is
simplified, thanks to LINQ and strong typing. This lets you focus on the data persistence logic rather
than on data access plumbing.
The Repository pattern is a well-documented way of working with a data source. In the book Patterns
of Enterprise Application Architecture, Martin Fowler describes a repository as follows:
A repository performs the tasks of an intermediary between the domain model layers and data
mapping, acting in a similar way to a set of domain objects in memory. Client objects declaratively
build queries and send them to the repositories for answers. Conceptually, a repository encapsulates a
set of objects stored in the database and operations that can be performed on them, providing a way
that is closer to the persistence layer. Repositories, also, support the purpose of separating, clearly
and in one direction, the dependency between the work domain and the data allocation or mapping.
Define one repository per aggregate
For each aggregate or aggregate root, you should create one repository class. You may be able to
leverage C# Generics to reduce the total number concrete classes you need to maintain (as
demonstrated later in this chapter). In a microservice based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns,
the only channel you should use to update the database should be the repositories. This is because
they have a one-to-one relationship with the aggregate root, which controls the aggregate’s
invariants and transactional consistency. It’s okay to query the database through other channels (as
you can do following a CQRS approach), because queries don’t change the state of the database.
However, the transactional area (that is, the updates) must always be controlled by the repositories
and the aggregate roots.
Basically, a repository allows you to populate data in memory that comes from the database in the
form of the domain entities. Once the entities are in memory, they can be changed and then persisted
back to the database through transactions.
As noted earlier, if you’re using the CQS/CQRS architectural pattern, the initial queries are performed
by side queries out of the domain model, performed by simple SQL statements using Dapper. This
approach is much more flexible than repositories because you can query and join any tables you
need, and these queries aren’t restricted by rules from the aggregates. That data goes to the
presentation layer or client app.
If the user makes changes, the data to be updated comes from the client app or presentation layer to
the application layer (such as a Web API service). When you receive a command in a command
handler, you use repositories to get the data you want to update from the database. You update it in
memory with the data passed with the commands, and you then add or update the data (domain
entities) in the database through a transaction.
239 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

It’s important to emphasize again that you should only define one repository for each aggregate root,
as shown in Figure 7-17. To achieve the goal of the aggregate root to maintain transactional
consistency between all the objects within the aggregate, you should never create a repository for
each table in the database.
Figure 7-17. The relationship between repositories, aggregates, and database tables
The above diagram shows the relationships between Domain and Infrastructure layers: Buyer
Aggregate depends on the IBuyerRepository and Order Aggregate depends on the IOrderRepository
interfaces, these interfaces are implemented in the Infrastructure layer by the corresponding
repositories that depend on UnitOfWork, also implemented there, that accesses the tables in the Data
tier.
Enforce one aggregate root per repository
It can be valuable to implement your repository design in such a way that it enforces the rule that only
aggregate roots should have repositories. You can create a generic or base repository type that
constrains the type of entities it works with to ensure they have the IAggregateRoot marker interface.
Thus, each repository class implemented at the infrastructure layer implements its own contract or
interface, as shown in the following code:
namespace Microsoft.eShopOnContainers.Services.Ordering.Infrastructure.Repositories
{
public class OrderRepository : IOrderRepository
{
// ...
240 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


}
}
Each specific repository interface implements the generic IRepository interface:
public interface IOrderRepository : IRepository<Order>
{
Order Add(Order order);
// ...
}
However, a better way to have the code enforce the convention that each repository is related to a
single aggregate is to implement a generic repository type. That way, it’s explicit that you’re using a
repository to target a specific aggregate. That can be easily done by implementing a generic
IRepository base interface, as in the following code:
public interface IRepository<T> where T : IAggregateRoot
{
//....
}
The Repository pattern makes it easier to test your application logic
The Repository pattern allows you to easily test your application with unit tests. Remember that unit
tests only test your code, not infrastructure, so the repository abstractions make it easier to achieve
that goal.
As noted in an earlier section, it’s recommended that you define and place the repository interfaces in
the domain model layer so the application layer, such as your Web API microservice, doesn’t depend
directly on the infrastructure layer where you’ve implemented the actual repository classes. By doing
this and using Dependency Injection in the controllers of your Web API, you can implement mock
repositories that return fake data instead of data from the database. This decoupled approach allows
you to create and run unit tests that focus the logic of your application without requiring connectivity
to the database.
Connections to databases can fail and, more importantly, running hundreds of tests against a
database is bad for two reasons. First, it can take a long time because of the large number of tests.
Second, the database records might change and impact the results of your tests, especially if your
tests are running in parallel, so that they might not be consistent. Unit tests typically can run in
parallel; integration tests may not support parallel execution depending on their implementation.
Testing against the database isn’t a unit test but an integration test. You should have many unit tests
running fast, but fewer integration tests against the databases.
In terms of separation of concerns for unit tests, your logic operates on domain entities in memory. It
assumes the repository class has delivered those. Once your logic modifies the domain entities, it
assumes the repository class will store them correctly. The important point here is to create unit tests
against your domain model and its domain logic. Aggregate roots are the main consistency
boundaries in DDD.
The repositories implemented in eShopOnContainers rely on EF Core’s DbContext implementation of
the Repository and Unit of Work patterns using its change tracker, so they don’t duplicate this
functionality.
241 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

The difference between the Repository pattern and the legacy Data Access class
(DAL class) pattern
A typical DAL object directly performs data access and persistence operations against storage, often
at the level of a single table and row. Simple CRUD operations implemented with a set of DAL classes
frequently do not support transactions (though this is not always the case). Most DAL class
approaches make minimal use of abstractions, resulting in tight coupling between application or
Business Logic Layer (BLL) classes that call the DAL objects.
When using repository, the implementation details of persistence are encapsulated away from the
domain model. The use of an abstraction provides ease of extending behavior through patterns like
Decorators or Proxies. For instance, cross-cutting concerns like caching, logging, and error handling
can all be applied using these patterns rather than hard-coded in the data access code itself. It’s also
trivial to support multiple repository adapters which may be used in different environments, from
local development to shared staging environments to production.
Implementing Unit of Work
A unit of work refers to a single transaction that involves multiple insert, update, or delete operations.
In simple terms, it means that for a specific user action, such as a registration on a website, all the
insert, update, and delete operations are handled in a single transaction. This is more efficient than
handling multiple database operations in a chattier way.
These multiple persistence operations are performed later in a single action when your code from the
application layer commands it. The decision about applying the in-memory changes to the actual
database storage is typically based on the Unit of Work pattern. In EF, the Unit of Work pattern is
implemented by a DbContext and is executed when a call is made to SaveChanges.
In many cases, this pattern or way of applying operations against the storage can increase application
performance and reduce the possibility of inconsistencies. It also reduces transaction blocking in the
database tables, because all the intended operations are committed as part of one transaction. This is
more efficient in comparison to executing many isolated operations against the database. Therefore,
the selected ORM can optimize the execution against the database by grouping several update
actions within the same transaction, as opposed to many small and separate transaction executions.
The Unit of Work pattern can be implemented with or without using the Repository pattern.
Repositories shouldn’t be mandatory
Custom repositories are useful for the reasons cited earlier, and that is the approach for the ordering
microservice in eShopOnContainers. However, it isn’t an essential pattern to implement in a DDD
design or even in general .NET development.
For instance, Jimmy Bogard, when providing direct feedback for this guide, said the following:
This’ll probably be my biggest feedback. I’m really not a fan of repositories, mainly because they hide
the important details of the underlying persistence mechanism. It’s why I go for MediatR for
commands, too. I can use the full power of the persistence layer, and push all that domain behavior
into my aggregate roots. I don’t usually want to mock my repositories – I still need to have that
242 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

integration test with the real thing. Going CQRS meant that we didn’t really have a need for
repositories any more.
Repositories might be useful, but they are not critical for your DDD design in the way that the
Aggregate pattern and a rich domain model are. Therefore, use the Repository pattern or not, as you
see fit.

Implement the infrastructure persistence layer with
Entity Framework Core
When you use relational databases such as SQL Server, Oracle, or PostgreSQL, a recommended
approach is to implement the persistence layer based on Entity Framework (EF). EF supports LINQ and
provides strongly typed objects for your model, as well as simplified persistence into your database.
Entity Framework has a long history as part of the .NET Framework. When you use .NET, you should
also use Entity Framework Core, which runs on Windows or Linux in the same way as .NET. EF Core is a
complete rewrite of Entity Framework that’s implemented with a much smaller footprint and
important improvements in performance.
243 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Introduction to Entity Framework Core
Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform version of the popular
Entity Framework data access technology. It was introduced with .NET Core in mid-2016.
Since an introduction to EF Core is already available in Microsoft documentation, here we simply
provide links to that information.

Infrastructure in Entity Framework Core from a DDD perspective
From a DDD point of view, an important capability of EF is the ability to use POCO domain entities,
also known in EF terminology as POCO code-first entities. If you use POCO domain entities, your
domain model classes are persistence-ignorant, following the Persistence Ignorance and the
Infrastructure Ignorance principles.
Per DDD patterns, you should encapsulate domain behavior and rules within the entity class itself, so
it can control invariants, validations, and rules when accessing any collection. Therefore, it is not a
good practice in DDD to allow public access to collections of child entities or value objects. Instead,
you want to expose methods that control how and when your fields and property collections can be
updated, and what behavior and actions should occur when that happens.
Since EF Core 1.1, to satisfy those DDD requirements, you can have plain fields in your entities instead
of public properties. If you do not want an entity field to be externally accessible, you can just create
the attribute or field instead of a property. You can also use private property setters.
In a similar way, you can now have read-only access to collections by using a public property typed as
IReadOnlyCollection<T>, which is backed by a private field member for the collection (like a List<T>)
in your entity that relies on EF for persistence. Previous versions of Entity Framework required
collection properties to support ICollection<T>, which meant that any developer using the parent
entity class could add or remove items through its property collections. That possibility would be
against the recommended patterns in DDD.
You can use a private collection while exposing a read-only IReadOnlyCollection<T> object, as shown
in the following code example:
public class Order : Entity
{
244 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

// Using private fields, allowed since EF Core 1.1
private DateTime _orderDate;
// Other fields ...
private readonly List<OrderItem> _orderItems;
public IReadOnlyCollection<OrderItem> OrderItems => _orderItems;
protected Order() { }
public Order(int buyerId, int paymentMethodId, Address address)
{
// Initializations ...
}
public void AddOrderItem(int productId, string productName,
decimal unitPrice, decimal discount,
string pictureUrl, int units = 1)
{
// Validation logic...
var orderItem = new OrderItem(productId, productName,
unitPrice, discount,
pictureUrl, units);
_orderItems.Add(orderItem);
}
}
The OrderItems property can only be accessed as read-only using IReadOnlyCollection<OrderItem>.
This type is read-only so it is protected against regular external updates.
EF Core provides a way to map the domain model to the physical database without “contaminating”
the domain model. It is pure .NET POCO code, because the mapping action is implemented in the
persistence layer. In that mapping action, you need to configure the fields-to-database mapping. In
the following example of the OnModelCreating method from OrderingContext and the
OrderEntityTypeConfiguration class, the call to SetPropertyAccessMode tells EF Core to access the
OrderItems property through its field.
// At OrderingContext.cs from eShopOnContainers
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
// ...
modelBuilder.ApplyConfiguration(new OrderEntityTypeConfiguration());
// Other entities' configuration ...
}
// At OrderEntityTypeConfiguration.cs from eShopOnContainers
class OrderEntityTypeConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<Order>
{
public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Order> orderConfiguration)
{
orderConfiguration.ToTable("orders", OrderingContext.DEFAULT_SCHEMA);
// Other configuration
var navigation =
orderConfiguration.Metadata.FindNavigation(nameof(Order.OrderItems));
//EF access the OrderItem collection property through its backing field
navigation.SetPropertyAccessMode(PropertyAccessMode.Field);
245 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


---

// Other configuration
}
}
When you use fields instead of properties, the OrderItem entity is persisted as if it had a
List<OrderItem> property. However, it exposes a single accessor, the AddOrderItem method, for
adding new items to the order. As a result, behavior and data are tied together and will be consistent
throughout any application code that uses the domain model.
Implement custom repositories with Entity Framework Core
At the implementation level, a repository is simply a class with data persistence code coordinated by a
unit of work (DBContext in EF Core) when performing updates, as shown in the following class:
// using directives...
namespace Microsoft.eShopOnContainers.Services.Ordering.Infrastructure.Repositories
{
public class BuyerRepository : IBuyerRepository
{
private readonly OrderingContext _context;
public IUnitOfWork UnitOfWork
{
get
{
return _context;
}
}
public BuyerRepository(OrderingContext context)
{
_context = context ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
}
public Buyer Add(Buyer buyer)
{
return _context.Buyers.Add(buyer).Entity;
}
public async Task<Buyer> FindAsync(string buyerIdentityGuid)
{
var buyer = await _context.Buyers
.Include(b => b.Payments)
.Where(b => b.FullName == buyerIdentityGuid)
.SingleOrDefaultAsync();
return buyer;
}
}
}
The IBuyerRepository interface comes from the domain model layer as a contract. However, the
repository implementation is done at the persistence and infrastructure layer.
The EF DbContext comes through the constructor through Dependency Injection. It is shared between
multiple repositories within the same HTTP request scope, thanks to its default lifetime
(ServiceLifetime.Scoped) in the IoC container (which can also be explicitly set with
services.AddDbContext<>).
246 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Methods to implement in a repository (updates or transactions versus queries)
Within each repository class, you should put the persistence methods that update the state of entities
contained by its related aggregate. Remember there is one-to-one relationship between an aggregate
and its related repository. Consider that an aggregate root entity object might have embedded child
entities within its EF graph. For example, a buyer might have multiple payment methods as related
child entities.
Since the approach for the ordering microservice in eShopOnContainers is also based on CQS/CQRS,
most of the queries are not implemented in custom repositories. Developers have the freedom to
create the queries and joins they need for the presentation layer without the restrictions imposed by
aggregates, custom repositories per aggregate, and DDD in general. Most of the custom repositories
suggested by this guide have several update or transactional methods but just the query methods
needed to get data to be updated. For example, the BuyerRepository repository implements a
FindAsync method, because the application needs to know whether a particular buyer exists before
creating a new buyer related to the order.
However, the real query methods to get data to send to the presentation layer or client apps are
implemented, as mentioned, in the CQRS queries based on flexible queries using Dapper.
Using a custom repository versus using EF DbContext directly
The Entity Framework DbContext class is based on the Unit of Work and Repository patterns and can
be used directly from your code, such as from an ASP.NET Core MVC controller. The Unit of Work and
Repository patterns result in the simplest code, as in the CRUD catalog microservice in
eShopOnContainers. In cases where you want the simplest code possible, you might want to directly
use the DbContext class, as many developers do.
However, implementing custom repositories provides several benefits when implementing more
complex microservices or applications. The Unit of Work and Repository patterns are intended to
encapsulate the infrastructure persistence layer so it is decoupled from the application and domain-
model layers. Implementing these patterns can facilitate the use of mock repositories simulating
access to the database.
In Figure 7-18, you can see the differences between not using repositories (directly using the EF
DbContext) versus using repositories, which makes it easier to mock those repositories.
247 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Figure 7-18. Using custom repositories versus a plain DbContext
Figure 7-18 shows that using a custom repository adds an abstraction layer that can be used to ease
testing by mocking the repository. There are multiple alternatives when mocking. You could mock just
repositories or you could mock a whole unit of work. Usually mocking just the repositories is enough,
and the complexity to abstract and mock a whole unit of work is usually not needed.
Later, when we focus on the application layer, you will see how Dependency Injection works in
ASP.NET Core and how it is implemented when using repositories.
In short, custom repositories allow you to test code more easily with unit tests that are not impacted
by the data tier state. If you run tests that also access the actual database through the Entity
Framework, they are not unit tests but integration tests, which are a lot slower.
If you were using DbContext directly, you would have to mock it or to run unit tests by using an in-
memory SQL Server with predictable data for unit tests. But mocking the DbContext or controlling
fake data requires more work than mocking at the repository level. Of course, you could always test
the MVC controllers.
EF DbContext and IUnitOfWork instance lifetime in your IoC container
The DbContext object (exposed as an IUnitOfWork object) should be shared among multiple
repositories within the same HTTP request scope. For example, this is true when the operation being
executed must deal with multiple aggregates, or simply because you are using multiple repository
instances. It is also important to mention that the IUnitOfWork interface is part of your domain layer,
not an EF Core type.
In order to do that, the instance of the DbContext object has to have its service lifetime set to
ServiceLifetime.Scoped. This is the default lifetime when registering a DbContext with
builder.Services.AddDbContext in your IoC container from the Program.cs file in your ASP.NET Core
Web API project. The following code illustrates this.
248 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


// Add framework services.
builder.Services.AddMvc(options =>
{
options.Filters.Add(typeof(HttpGlobalExceptionFilter));
}).AddControllersAsServices();
builder.Services.AddEntityFrameworkSqlServer()
.AddDbContext<OrderingContext>(options =>
{
options.UseSqlServer(Configuration["ConnectionString"],
sqlOptions =>
sqlOptions.MigrationsAssembly(typeof(Startup).GetTypeInfo().
Assembly.GetName().Name));
},
ServiceLifetime.Scoped // Note that Scoped is the default choice
// in AddDbContext. It is shown here only for
// pedagogic purposes.
);
The DbContext instantiation mode should not be configured as ServiceLifetime.Transient or
ServiceLifetime.Singleton.
The repository instance lifetime in your IoC container
In a similar way, repository’s lifetime should usually be set as scoped (InstancePerLifetimeScope in
Autofac). It could also be transient (InstancePerDependency in Autofac), but your service will be more
efficient in regards to memory when using the scoped lifetime.
// Registering a Repository in Autofac IoC container
builder.RegisterType<OrderRepository>()
.As<IOrderRepository>()
.InstancePerLifetimeScope();
Using the singleton lifetime for the repository could cause you serious concurrency problems when
your DbContext is set to scoped (InstancePerLifetimeScope) lifetime (the default lifetimes for a
DBContext). As long as your service lifetimes for your repositories and your DbContext are both
Scoped, you’ll avoid these issues.

Table mapping
Table mapping identifies the table data to be queried from and saved to the database. Previously you
saw how domain entities (for example, a product or order domain) can be used to generate a related
database schema. EF is strongly designed around the concept of conventions. Conventions address
questions like “What will the name of a table be?” or “What property is the primary key?” Conventions
are typically based on conventional names. For example, it is typical for the primary key to be a
property that ends with Id.
By convention, each entity will be set up to map to a table with the same name as the DbSet<TEntity>
property that exposes the entity on the derived context. If no DbSet<TEntity> value is provided for
the given entity, the class name is used.
Data Annotations versus Fluent API
There are many additional EF Core conventions, and most of them can be changed by using either
data annotations or Fluent API, implemented within the OnModelCreating method.
Data annotations must be used on the entity model classes themselves, which is a more intrusive way
from a DDD point of view. This is because you are contaminating your model with data annotations
related to the infrastructure database. On the other hand, Fluent API is a convenient way to change
most conventions and mappings within your data persistence infrastructure layer, so the entity model
will be clean and decoupled from the persistence infrastructure.
Fluent API and the OnModelCreating method
As mentioned, in order to change conventions and mappings, you can use the OnModelCreating
method in the DbContext class.
The ordering microservice in eShopOnContainers implements explicit mapping and configuration,
when needed, as shown in the following code.
// At OrderingContext.cs from eShopOnContainers
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
// ...
modelBuilder.ApplyConfiguration(new OrderEntityTypeConfiguration());
// Other entities' configuration ...
}
// At OrderEntityTypeConfiguration.cs from eShopOnContainers
class OrderEntityTypeConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<Order>
{
public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Order> orderConfiguration)
{
orderConfiguration.ToTable("orders", OrderingContext.DEFAULT_SCHEMA);
orderConfiguration.HasKey(o => o.Id);
orderConfiguration.Ignore(b => b.DomainEvents);
orderConfiguration.Property(o => o.Id)
.UseHiLo("orderseq", OrderingContext.DEFAULT_SCHEMA);
250 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

//Address value object persisted as owned entity type supported since EF Core 2.0
orderConfiguration
.OwnsOne(o => o.Address, a =>
{
a.WithOwner();
});
orderConfiguration
.Property<int?>("_buyerId")
.UsePropertyAccessMode(PropertyAccessMode.Field)
.HasColumnName("BuyerId")
.IsRequired(false);
orderConfiguration
.Property<DateTime>("_orderDate")
.UsePropertyAccessMode(PropertyAccessMode.Field)
.HasColumnName("OrderDate")
.IsRequired();
orderConfiguration
.Property<int>("_orderStatusId")
.UsePropertyAccessMode(PropertyAccessMode.Field)
.HasColumnName("OrderStatusId")
.IsRequired();
orderConfiguration
.Property<int?>("_paymentMethodId")
.UsePropertyAccessMode(PropertyAccessMode.Field)
.HasColumnName("PaymentMethodId")
.IsRequired(false);
orderConfiguration.Property<string>("Description").IsRequired(false);
var navigation =
orderConfiguration.Metadata.FindNavigation(nameof(Order.OrderItems));
// DDD Patterns comment:
//Set as field (New since EF 1.1) to access the OrderItem collection property
through its field
navigation.SetPropertyAccessMode(PropertyAccessMode.Field);
orderConfiguration.HasOne<PaymentMethod>()
.WithMany()
.HasForeignKey("_paymentMethodId")
.IsRequired(false)
.OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Restrict);
orderConfiguration.HasOne<Buyer>()
.WithMany()
.IsRequired(false)
.HasForeignKey("_buyerId");
orderConfiguration.HasOne(o => o.OrderStatus)
.WithMany()
.HasForeignKey("_orderStatusId");
}
}
You could set all the Fluent API mappings within the same OnModelCreating method, but it’s
advisable to partition that code and have multiple configuration classes, one per entity, as shown in
251 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

the example. Especially for large models, it is advisable to have separate configuration classes for
configuring different entity types.
The code in the example shows a few explicit declarations and mapping. However, EF Core
conventions do many of those mappings automatically, so the actual code you would need in your
case might be smaller.
The Hi/Lo algorithm in EF Core
An interesting aspect of code in the preceding example is that it uses the Hi/Lo algorithm as the key
generation strategy.
The Hi/Lo algorithm is useful when you need unique keys before committing changes. As a summary,
the Hi-Lo algorithm assigns unique identifiers to table rows while not depending on storing the row in
the database immediately. This lets you start using the identifiers right away, as happens with regular
sequential database IDs.
The Hi/Lo algorithm describes a mechanism for getting a batch of unique IDs from a related database
sequence. These IDs are safe to use because the database guarantees the uniqueness, so there will be
no collisions between users. This algorithm is interesting for these reasons:
• It does not break the Unit of Work pattern.
• It gets sequence IDs in batches, to minimize round trips to the database.
• It generates a human readable identifier, unlike techniques that use GUIDs.
EF Core supports HiLo with the UseHiLo method, as shown in the preceding example.
Map fields instead of properties
With this feature, available since EF Core 1.1, you can directly map columns to fields. It is possible to
not use properties in the entity class, and just to map columns from a table to fields. A common use
for that would be private fields for any internal state that do not need to be accessed from outside the
entity.
You can do this with single fields or also with collections, like a List<> field. This point was mentioned
earlier when we discussed modeling the domain model classes, but here you can see how that
mapping is performed with the PropertyAccessMode.Field configuration highlighted in the previous
code.
Use shadow properties in EF Core, hidden at the infrastructure level
Shadow properties in EF Core are properties that do not exist in your entity class model. The values
and states of these properties are maintained purely in the ChangeTracker class at the infrastructure
level.
252 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Implement the Query Specification pattern
As introduced earlier in the design section, the Query Specification pattern is a Domain-Driven Design
pattern designed as the place where you can put the definition of a query with optional sorting and
paging logic.
The Query Specification pattern defines a query in an object. For example, in order to encapsulate a
paged query that searches for some products you can create a PagedProduct specification that takes
the necessary input parameters (pageNumber, pageSize, filter, etc.). Then, within any Repository
method (usually a List() overload) it would accept an IQuerySpecification and run the expected query
based on that specification.
An example of a generic Specification interface is the following code, which is similar to code used in
the eShopOnWeb reference application.
// GENERIC SPECIFICATION INTERFACE
// https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb
public interface ISpecification<T>
{
Expression<Func<T, bool>> Criteria { get; }
List<Expression<Func<T, object>>> Includes { get; }
List<string> IncludeStrings { get; }
}
Then, the implementation of a generic specification base class is the following.
// GENERIC SPECIFICATION IMPLEMENTATION (BASE CLASS)
// https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb
public abstract class BaseSpecification<T> : ISpecification<T>
{
public BaseSpecification(Expression<Func<T, bool>> criteria)
{
Criteria = criteria;
}
public Expression<Func<T, bool>> Criteria { get; }
public List<Expression<Func<T, object>>> Includes { get; } =
new List<Expression<Func<T, object>>>();
public List<string> IncludeStrings { get; } = new List<string>();
protected virtual void AddInclude(Expression<Func<T, object>> includeExpression)
{
Includes.Add(includeExpression);
}
// string-based includes allow for including children of children
// e.g. Basket.Items.Product
protected virtual void AddInclude(string includeString)
{
IncludeStrings.Add(includeString);
}
}
253 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

The following specification loads a single basket entity given either the basket’s ID or the ID of the
buyer to whom the basket belongs. It will eagerly load the basket’s Items collection.
// SAMPLE QUERY SPECIFICATION IMPLEMENTATION
public class BasketWithItemsSpecification : BaseSpecification<Basket>
{
public BasketWithItemsSpecification(int basketId)
: base(b => b.Id == basketId)
{
AddInclude(b => b.Items);
}
public BasketWithItemsSpecification(string buyerId)
: base(b => b.BuyerId == buyerId)
{
AddInclude(b => b.Items);
}
}
And finally, you can see below how a generic EF Repository can use such a specification to filter and
eager-load data related to a given entity type T.
// GENERIC EF REPOSITORY WITH SPECIFICATION
// https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb
public IEnumerable<T> List(ISpecification<T> spec)
{
// fetch a Queryable that includes all expression-based includes
var queryableResultWithIncludes = spec.Includes
.Aggregate(_dbContext.Set<T>().AsQueryable(),
(current, include) => current.Include(include));
// modify the IQueryable to include any string-based include statements
var secondaryResult = spec.IncludeStrings
.Aggregate(queryableResultWithIncludes,
(current, include) => current.Include(include));
// return the result of the query using the specification's criteria expression
return secondaryResult
.Where(spec.Criteria)
.AsEnumerable();
}
In addition to encapsulating filtering logic, the specification can specify the shape of the data to be
returned, including which properties to populate.
Although we don’t recommend returning IQueryable from a repository, it’s perfectly fine to use them
within the repository to build up a set of results. You can see this approach used in the List method
above, which uses intermediate IQueryable expressions to build up the query’s list of includes before
executing the query with the specification’s criteria on the last line.
Learn how the specification pattern is applied in the eShopOnWeb sample.

Use NoSQL databases as a persistence infrastructure
When you use NoSQL databases for your infrastructure data tier, you typically do not use an ORM like
Entity Framework Core. Instead you use the API provided by the NoSQL engine, such as Azure Cosmos
DB, MongoDB, Cassandra, RavenDB, CouchDB, or Azure Storage Tables.
However, when you use a NoSQL database, especially a document-oriented database like Azure
Cosmos DB, CouchDB, or RavenDB, the way you design your model with DDD aggregates is partially
similar to how you can do it in EF Core, in regards to the identification of aggregate roots, child entity
classes, and value object classes. But, ultimately, the database selection will impact in your design.
When you use a document-oriented database, you implement an aggregate as a single document,
serialized in JSON or another format. However, the use of the database is transparent from a domain
model code point of view. When using a NoSQL database, you still are using entity classes and
aggregate root classes, but with more flexibility than when using EF Core because the persistence is
not relational.
The difference is in how you persist that model. If you implemented your domain model based on
POCO entity classes, agnostic to the infrastructure persistence, it might look like you could move to a
different persistence infrastructure, even from relational to NoSQL. However, that should not be your
goal. There are always constraints and trade-offs in the different database technologies, so you will
not be able to have the same model for relational or NoSQL databases. Changing persistence models
is not a trivial task, because transactions and persistence operations will be very different.
For example, in a document-oriented database, it is okay for an aggregate root to have multiple child
collection properties. In a relational database, querying multiple child collection properties is not
255 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


---

easily optimized, because you get a UNION ALL SQL statement back from EF. Having the same
domain model for relational databases or NoSQL databases is not simple, and you should not try to
do it. You really have to design your model with an understanding of how the data is going to be
used in each particular database.
A benefit when using NoSQL databases is that the entities are more denormalized, so you do not set a
table mapping. Your domain model can be more flexible than when using a relational database.
When you design your domain model based on aggregates, moving to NoSQL and document-
oriented databases might be even easier than using a relational database, because the aggregates
you design are similar to serialized documents in a document-oriented database. Then you can
include in those “bags” all the information you might need for that aggregate.
For instance, the following JSON code is a sample implementation of an order aggregate when using
a document-oriented database. It is similar to the order aggregate we implemented in the
eShopOnContainers sample, but without using EF Core underneath.

automatically indexes data without requiring you to deal with schema and index management. It is
multi-model and supports document, key-value, graph, and columnar data models.
256 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Figure 7-19. Azure Cosmos DB global distribution
When you use a C# model to implement the aggregate to be used by the Azure Cosmos DB API, the
aggregate can be similar to the C# POCO classes used with EF Core. The difference is in the way to
use them from the application and infrastructure layers, as in the following code:
// C# EXAMPLE OF AN ORDER AGGREGATE BEING PERSISTED WITH AZURE COSMOS DB API
// *** Domain Model Code ***
// Aggregate: Create an Order object with its child entities and/or value objects.
// Then, use AggregateRoot's methods to add the nested objects so invariants and
// logic is consistent across the nested properties (value objects and entities).
Order orderAggregate = new Order
{
Id = "2024001",
OrderDate = new DateTime(2005, 7, 1),
BuyerId = "1234567",
PurchaseOrderNumber = "PO18009186470"
}
Address address = new Address
{
Street = "100 One Microsoft Way",
City = "Redmond",
State = "WA",
Zip = "98052",
Country = "U.S."
}
orderAggregate.UpdateAddress(address);
OrderItem orderItem1 = new OrderItem
{
257 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


Id = 20240011,
ProductId = "123456",
ProductName = ".NET T-Shirt",
UnitPrice = 25,
Units = 2,
Discount = 0;
};
//Using methods with domain logic within the entity. No anemic-domain model
orderAggregate.AddOrderItem(orderItem1);
// *** End of Domain Model Code ***
// *** Infrastructure Code using Cosmos DB Client API ***
Uri collectionUri = UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri(databaseName,
collectionName);
await client.CreateDocumentAsync(collectionUri, orderAggregate);
// As your app evolves, let's say your object has a new schema. You can insert
// OrderV2 objects without any changes to the database tier.
Order2 newOrder = GetOrderV2Sample("IdForSalesOrder2");
await client.CreateDocumentAsync(collectionUri, newOrder);
You can see that the way you work with your domain model can be similar to the way you use it in
your domain model layer when the infrastructure is EF. You still use the same aggregate root methods
to ensure consistency, invariants, and validations within the aggregate.
However, when you persist your model into the NoSQL database, the code and API change
dramatically compared to EF Core code or any other code related to relational databases.
Implement .NET code targeting MongoDB and Azure Cosmos DB
Use Azure Cosmos DB from .NET containers
You can access Azure Cosmos DB databases from .NET code running in containers, like from any other
.NET application. For instance, the Locations.API and Marketing.API microservices in
eShopOnContainers are implemented so they can consume Azure Cosmos DB databases.
However, there’s a limitation in Azure Cosmos DB from a Docker development environment point of
view. Even though there’s an on-premises Azure Cosmos DB Emulator that can run in a local
development machine, it only supports Windows. Linux and macOS aren’t supported.
There’s also the possibility to run this emulator on Docker, but just on Windows Containers, not with
Linux Containers. That’s an initial handicap for the development environment if your application is
deployed as Linux containers, since, currently, you can’t deploy Linux and Windows Containers on
Docker for Windows at the same time. Either all containers being deployed have to be for Linux or for
Windows.
The ideal and more straightforward deployment for a dev/test solution is to be able to deploy your
database systems as containers along with your custom containers so your dev/test environments are
always consistent.
258 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Use MongoDB API for local dev/test Linux/Windows containers plus Azure Cosmos
DB
Cosmos DB databases support MongoDB API for .NET as well as the native MongoDB wire protocol.
This means that by using existing drivers, your application written for MongoDB can now
communicate with Cosmos DB and use Cosmos DB databases instead of MongoDB databases, as
shown in Figure 7-20.
Figure 7-20. Using MongoDB API and protocol to access Azure Cosmos DB
This is a very convenient approach for proof of concepts in Docker environments with Linux
containers because the MongoDB Docker image is a multi-arch image that supports Docker Linux
containers and Docker Windows containers.
As shown in the following image, by using the MongoDB API, eShopOnContainers supports MongoDB
Linux and Windows containers for the local development environment but then, you can move to a
scalable, PaaS cloud solution as Azure Cosmos DB by simply changing the MongoDB connection
string to point to Azure Cosmos DB.
259 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


Figure 7-21. eShopOnContainers using MongoDB containers for dev-env or Azure Cosmos DB for production
The production Azure Cosmos DB would be running in Azure’s cloud as a PaaS and scalable service.
Your custom .NET containers can run on a local development Docker host (that is using Docker for
Windows in a Windows 10 machine) or be deployed into a production environment, like Kubernetes in
Azure AKS or Azure Service Fabric. In this second environment, you would deploy only the .NET
custom containers but not the MongoDB container since you’d be using Azure Cosmos DB in the
cloud for handling the data in production.
A clear benefit of using the MongoDB API is that your solution could run in both database engines,
MongoDB or Azure Cosmos DB, so migrations to different environments should be easy. However,
sometimes it is worthwhile to use a native API (that is the native Cosmos DB API) in order to take full
advantage of the capabilities of a specific database engine.
For further comparison between simply using MongoDB versus Cosmos DB in the cloud, see the
Benefits of using Azure Cosmos DB in this page.
Analyze your approach for production applications: MongoDB API vs. Cosmos DB
API
In eShopOnContainers, we’re using MongoDB API because our priority was fundamentally to have a
consistent dev/test environment using a NoSQL database that could also work with Azure Cosmos DB.
260 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


However, if you are planning to use MongoDB API to access Azure Cosmos DB in Azure for
production applications, you should analyze the differences in capabilities and performance when
using MongoDB API to access Azure Cosmos DB databases compared to using the native Azure
Cosmos DB API. If it is similar you can use MongoDB API and you get the benefit of supporting two
NoSQL database engines at the same time.
You could also use MongoDB clusters as the production database in Azure’s cloud, too, with
MongoDB Azure Service. But that is not a PaaS service provided by Microsoft. In this case, Azure is just
hosting that solution coming from MongoDB.
Basically, this is just a disclaimer stating that you shouldn’t always use MongoDB API against Azure
Cosmos DB, as we did in eShopOnContainers because it was a convenient choice for Linux containers.
The decision should be based on the specific needs and tests you need to do for your production
application.
The code: Use MongoDB API in .NET applications
MongoDB API for .NET is based on NuGet packages that you need to add to your projects, like in the
Locations.API project shown in the following figure.
261 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Figure 7-22. MongoDB API NuGet packages references in a .NET project
Let’s investigate the code in the following sections.
A Model used by MongoDB API
First, you need to define a model that will hold the data coming from the database in your
application’s memory space. Here’s an example of the model used for Locations at
eShopOnContainers.
using MongoDB.Bson;
using MongoDB.Bson.Serialization.Attributes;
using MongoDB.Driver.GeoJsonObjectModel;
using System.Collections.Generic;
public class Locations
{
262 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


[BsonId]
[BsonRepresentation(BsonType.ObjectId)]
public string Id { get; set; }
public int LocationId { get; set; }
public string Code { get; set; }
[BsonRepresentation(BsonType.ObjectId)]
public string Parent_Id { get; set; }
public string Description { get; set; }
public double Latitude { get; set; }
public double Longitude { get; set; }
public GeoJsonPoint<GeoJson2DGeographicCoordinates> Location
{ get; private set; }
public GeoJsonPolygon<GeoJson2DGeographicCoordinates> Polygon
{ get; private set; }
public void SetLocation(double lon, double lat) => SetPosition(lon, lat);
public void SetArea(List<GeoJson2DGeographicCoordinates> coordinatesList)
=> SetPolygon(coordinatesList);
private void SetPosition(double lon, double lat)
{
Latitude = lat;
Longitude = lon;
Location = new GeoJsonPoint<GeoJson2DGeographicCoordinates>(
new GeoJson2DGeographicCoordinates(lon, lat));
}
private void SetPolygon(List<GeoJson2DGeographicCoordinates> coordinatesList)
{
Polygon = new GeoJsonPolygon<GeoJson2DGeographicCoordinates>(
new GeoJsonPolygonCoordinates<GeoJson2DGeographicCoordinates>(
new GeoJsonLinearRingCoordinates<GeoJson2DGeographicCoordinates>(
coordinatesList)));
}
}
You can see there are a few attributes and types coming from the MongoDB NuGet packages.
NoSQL databases are usually very well suited for working with non-relational hierarchical data. In this
example, we are using MongoDB types especially made for geo-locations, like
GeoJson2DGeographicCoordinates.
Retrieve the database and the collection
In eShopOnContainers, we have created a custom database context where we implement the code to
retrieve the database and the MongoCollections, as in the following code.
public class LocationsContext
{
private readonly IMongoDatabase _database = null;
public LocationsContext(IOptions<LocationSettings> settings)
{
var client = new MongoClient(settings.Value.ConnectionString);
if (client != null)
_database = client.GetDatabase(settings.Value.Database);
}
public IMongoCollection<Locations> Locations
{
263 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

get
{
return _database.GetCollection<Locations>("Locations");
}
}
}
Retrieve the data
In C# code, like Web API controllers or custom Repositories implementation, you can write similar
code to the following when querying through the MongoDB API. Note that the _context object is an
instance of the previous LocationsContext class.
public async Task<Locations> GetAsync(int locationId)
{
var filter = Builders<Locations>.Filter.Eq("LocationId", locationId);
return await _context.Locations
.Find(filter)
.FirstOrDefaultAsync();
}
Use an env-var in the docker-compose.override.yml file for the MongoDB connection
string
When creating a MongoClient object, it needs a fundamental parameter which is precisely the
ConnectionString parameter pointing to the right database. In the case of eShopOnContainers, the
connection string can point to a local MongoDB Docker container or to a “production” Azure Cosmos
DB database. That connection string comes from the environment variables defined in the docker-
compose.override.yml files used when deploying with docker-compose or Visual Studio, as in the
following yml code.
# docker-compose.override.yml
version: '3.4'
services:
# Other services
locations-api:
environment:
# Other settings
- ConnectionString=${ESHOP_AZURE_COSMOSDB:-mongodb://nosqldata}
The ConnectionString environment variable is resolved this way: If the ESHOP_AZURE_COSMOSDB
global variable is defined in the .env file with the Azure Cosmos DB connection string, it will use it to
access the Azure Cosmos DB database in the cloud. If it’s not defined, it will take the
mongodb://nosqldata value and use the development MongoDB container.
The following code shows the .env file with the Azure Cosmos DB connection string global
environment variable, as implemented in eShopOnContainers:
# .env file, in eShopOnContainers root folder
# Other Docker environment variables
ESHOP_EXTERNAL_DNS_NAME_OR_IP=host.docker.internal
ESHOP_PROD_EXTERNAL_DNS_NAME_OR_IP=<YourDockerHostIP>
#ESHOP_AZURE_COSMOSDB=<YourAzureCosmosDBConnData>
264 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

#Other environment variables for additional Azure infrastructure assets
#ESHOP_AZURE_REDIS_BASKET_DB=<YourAzureRedisBasketInfo>
#ESHOP_AZURE_STORAGE_CATALOG_URL=<YourAzureStorage_Catalog_BLOB_URL>
#ESHOP_AZURE_SERVICE_BUS=<YourAzureServiceBusInfo>
Uncomment the ESHOP_AZURE_COSMOSDB line and update it with your Azure Cosmos DB
connection string obtained from the Azure portal as explained in Connect a MongoDB application to
Azure Cosmos DB.
If the ESHOP_AZURE_COSMOSDB global variable is empty, meaning it’s commented out in the .env
file, then the container uses a default MongoDB connection string. This connection string points to
the local MongoDB container deployed in eShopOnContainers that is named nosqldata and was
defined at the docker-compose file, as shown in the following .yml code:
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.4'
services:
# ...Other services...
nosqldata:
image: mongo

Design the microservice application layer and Web
API
Use SOLID principles and Dependency Injection
SOLID principles are critical techniques to be used in any modern and mission-critical application,
such as developing a microservice with DDD patterns. SOLID is an acronym that groups five
fundamental principles:
• Single Responsibility principle
• Open/closed principle
• Liskov substitution principle
• Interface Segregation principle
• Dependency Inversion principle
SOLID is more about how you design your application or microservice internal layers and about
decoupling dependencies between them. It is not related to the domain, but to the application’s
technical design. The final principle, the Dependency Inversion principle, allows you to decouple the
infrastructure layer from the rest of the layers, which allows a better decoupled implementation of the
DDD layers.
Dependency Injection (DI) is one way to implement the Dependency Inversion principle. It is a
technique for achieving loose coupling between objects and their dependencies. Rather than directly
instantiating collaborators, or using static references (that is, using new…), the objects that a class
needs in order to perform its actions are provided to (or “injected into”) the class. Most often, classes
will declare their dependencies via their constructor, allowing them to follow the Explicit
Dependencies principle. Dependency Injection is usually based on specific Inversion of Control (IoC)
containers. ASP.NET Core provides a simple built-in IoC container, but you can also use your favorite
IoC container, like Autofac or Ninject.
By following the SOLID principles, your classes will tend naturally to be small, well-factored, and easily
tested. But how can you know if too many dependencies are being injected into your classes? If you
use DI through the constructor, it will be easy to detect that by just looking at the number of
parameters for your constructor. If there are too many dependencies, this is generally a sign (a code
smell) that your class is trying to do too much, and is probably violating the Single Responsibility
principle.
It would take another guide to cover SOLID in detail. Therefore, this guide requires you to have only a
minimum knowledge of these topics.

Implement the microservice application layer using
the Web API
Use Dependency Injection to inject infrastructure objects into your
application layer
As mentioned previously, the application layer can be implemented as part of the artifact (assembly)
you are building, such as within a Web API project or an MVC web app project. In the case of a
microservice built with ASP.NET Core, the application layer will usually be your Web API library. If you
want to separate what is coming from ASP.NET Core (its infrastructure plus your controllers) from your
custom application layer code, you could also place your application layer in a separate class library,
but that is optional.
For instance, the application layer code of the ordering microservice is directly implemented as part of
the Ordering.API project (an ASP.NET Core Web API project), as shown in Figure 7-23.
Figure 7-23. The application layer in the Ordering.API ASP.NET Core Web API project
ASP.NET Core includes a simple built-in IoC container (represented by the IServiceProvider interface)
that supports constructor injection by default, and ASP.NET makes certain services available through
DI. ASP.NET Core uses the term service for any of the types you register that will be injected through
DI. You configure the built-in container’s services in your application’s Program.cs file. Your
267 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


dependencies are implemented in the services that a type needs and that you register in the IoC
container.
Typically, you want to inject dependencies that implement infrastructure objects. A typical
dependency to inject is a repository. But you could inject any other infrastructure dependency that
you may have. For simpler implementations, you could directly inject your Unit of Work pattern object
(the EF DbContext object), because the DBContext is also the implementation of your infrastructure
persistence objects.
In the following example, you can see how .NET is injecting the required repository objects through
the constructor. The class is a command handler, which will get covered in the next section.
public class CreateOrderCommandHandler
: IRequestHandler<CreateOrderCommand, bool>
{
private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;
private readonly IIdentityService _identityService;
private readonly IMediator _mediator;
private readonly IOrderingIntegrationEventService _orderingIntegrationEventService;
private readonly ILogger<CreateOrderCommandHandler> _logger;
// Using DI to inject infrastructure persistence Repositories
public CreateOrderCommandHandler(IMediator mediator,
IOrderingIntegrationEventService orderingIntegrationEventService,
IOrderRepository orderRepository,
IIdentityService identityService,
ILogger<CreateOrderCommandHandler> logger)
{
_orderRepository = orderRepository ?? throw new
ArgumentNullException(nameof(orderRepository));
_identityService = identityService ?? throw new
ArgumentNullException(nameof(identityService));
_mediator = mediator ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(mediator));
_orderingIntegrationEventService = orderingIntegrationEventService ?? throw new
ArgumentNullException(nameof(orderingIntegrationEventService));
_logger = logger ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(logger));
}
public async Task<bool> Handle(CreateOrderCommand message, CancellationToken
cancellationToken)
{
// Add Integration event to clean the basket
var orderStartedIntegrationEvent = new
OrderStartedIntegrationEvent(message.UserId);
await
_orderingIntegrationEventService.AddAndSaveEventAsync(orderStartedIntegrationEvent);
// Add/Update the Buyer AggregateRoot
// DDD patterns comment: Add child entities and value-objects through the Order
Aggregate-Root
// methods and constructor so validations, invariants and business logic
// make sure that consistency is preserved across the whole aggregate
var address = new Address(message.Street, message.City, message.State,
message.Country, message.ZipCode);
var order = new Order(message.UserId, message.UserName, address,
message.CardTypeId, message.CardNumber, message.CardSecurityNumber, message.CardHolderName,
message.CardExpiration);
foreach (var item in message.OrderItems)
268 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

{
order.AddOrderItem(item.ProductId, item.ProductName, item.UnitPrice,
item.Discount, item.PictureUrl, item.Units);
}
_logger.LogInformation("----- Creating Order - Order: {@Order}", order);
_orderRepository.Add(order);
return await _orderRepository.UnitOfWork
.SaveEntitiesAsync(cancellationToken);
}
}
The class uses the injected repositories to execute the transaction and persist the state changes. It
does not matter whether that class is a command handler, an ASP.NET Core Web API controller
method, or a DDD Application Service. It is ultimately a simple class that uses repositories, domain
entities, and other application coordination in a fashion similar to a command handler. Dependency
Injection works the same way for all the mentioned classes, as in the example using DI based on the
constructor.
Register the dependency implementation types and interfaces or abstractions
Before you use the objects injected through constructors, you need to know where to register the
interfaces and classes that produce the objects injected into your application classes through DI. (Like
DI based on the constructor, as shown previously.)
Use the built-in IoC container provided by ASP.NET Core
When you use the built-in IoC container provided by ASP.NET Core, you register the types you want
to inject in the Program.cs file, as in the following code:
// Register out-of-the-box framework services.
builder.Services.AddDbContext<CatalogContext>(c =>
c.UseSqlServer(Configuration["ConnectionString"]),
ServiceLifetime.Scoped);
builder.Services.AddMvc();
// Register custom application dependencies.
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMyCustomRepository, MyCustomSQLRepository>();
The most common pattern when registering types in an IoC container is to register a pair of types—an
interface and its related implementation class. Then when you request an object from the IoC
container through any constructor, you request an object of a certain type of interface. For instance, in
the previous example, the last line states that when any of your constructors have a dependency on
IMyCustomRepository (interface or abstraction), the IoC container will inject an instance of the
MyCustomSQLServerRepository implementation class.
Use the Scrutor library for automatic types registration
When using DI in .NET, you might want to be able to scan an assembly and automatically register its
types by convention. This feature is not currently available in ASP.NET Core. However, you can use the
269 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Scrutor library for that. This approach is convenient when you have dozens of types that need to be
registered in your IoC container.
Additional resources
• Matthew King. Registering services with Scrutor
https://www.mking.net/blog/registering-services-with-scrutor
• Kristian Hellang. Scrutor. GitHub repo.
https://github.com/khellang/Scrutor
Use Autofac as an IoC container
You can also use additional IoC containers and plug them into the ASP.NET Core pipeline, as in the
ordering microservice in eShopOnContainers, which uses Autofac. When using Autofac you typically
register the types via modules, which allow you to split the registration types between multiple files
depending on where your types are, just as you could have the application types distributed across
multiple class libraries.
For example, the following is the Autofac application module for the Ordering.API Web API project
with the types you will want to inject.
public class ApplicationModule : Autofac.Module
{
public string QueriesConnectionString { get; }
public ApplicationModule(string qconstr)
{
QueriesConnectionString = qconstr;
}
protected override void Load(ContainerBuilder builder)
{
builder.Register(c => new OrderQueries(QueriesConnectionString))
.As<IOrderQueries>()
.InstancePerLifetimeScope();
builder.RegisterType<BuyerRepository>()
.As<IBuyerRepository>()
.InstancePerLifetimeScope();
builder.RegisterType<OrderRepository>()
.As<IOrderRepository>()
.InstancePerLifetimeScope();
builder.RegisterType<RequestManager>()
.As<IRequestManager>()
.InstancePerLifetimeScope();
}
}
Autofac also has a feature to scan assemblies and register types by name conventions.
The registration process and concepts are very similar to the way you can register types with the built-
in ASP.NET Core IoC container, but the syntax when using Autofac is a bit different.
In the example code, the abstraction IOrderRepository is registered along with the implementation
class OrderRepository. This means that whenever a constructor is declaring a dependency through the
270 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

IOrderRepository abstraction or interface, the IoC container will inject an instance of the
OrderRepository class.
The instance scope type determines how an instance is shared between requests for the same service
or dependency. When a request is made for a dependency, the IoC container can return the following:
• A single instance per lifetime scope (referred to in the ASP.NET Core IoC container as scoped).
• A new instance per dependency (referred to in the ASP.NET Core IoC container as transient).
• A single instance shared across all objects using the IoC container (referred to in the ASP.NET
Core IoC container as singleton).

Implement the Command and Command Handler patterns
In the DI-through-constructor example shown in the previous section, the IoC container was injecting
repositories through a constructor in a class. But exactly where were they injected? In a simple Web
API (for example, the catalog microservice in eShopOnContainers), you inject them at the MVC
controllers’ level, in a controller constructor, as part of the request pipeline of ASP.NET Core. However,
in the initial code of this section (the CreateOrderCommandHandler class from the Ordering.API
service in eShopOnContainers), the injection of dependencies is done through the constructor of a
particular command handler. Let us explain what a command handler is and why you would want to
use it.
The Command pattern is intrinsically related to the CQRS pattern that was introduced earlier in this
guide. CQRS has two sides. The first area is queries, using simplified queries with the Dapper micro
ORM, which was explained previously. The second area is commands, which are the starting point for
transactions, and the input channel from outside the service.
As shown in Figure 7-24, the pattern is based on accepting commands from the client-side,
processing them based on the domain model rules, and finally persisting the states with transactions.
271 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Figure 7-24. High-level view of the commands or “transactional side” in a CQRS pattern
Figure 7-24 shows that the UI app sends a command through the API that gets to a
CommandHandler, that depends on the Domain model and the Infrastructure, to update the
database.
The command class
A command is a request for the system to perform an action that changes the state of the system.
Commands are imperative, and should be processed just once.
Since commands are imperatives, they are typically named with a verb in the imperative mood (for
example, “create” or “update”), and they might include the aggregate type, such as
CreateOrderCommand. Unlike an event, a command is not a fact from the past; it is only a request,
and thus may be refused.
Commands can originate from the UI as a result of a user initiating a request, or from a process
manager when the process manager is directing an aggregate to perform an action.
An important characteristic of a command is that it should be processed just once by a single receiver.
This is because a command is a single action or transaction you want to perform in the application.
For example, the same order creation command should not be processed more than once. This is an
important difference between commands and events. Events may be processed multiple times,
because many systems or microservices might be interested in the event.
In addition, it is important that a command be processed only once in case the command is not
idempotent. A command is idempotent if it can be executed multiple times without changing the
result, either because of the nature of the command, or because of the way the system handles the
command.
It is a good practice to make your commands and updates idempotent when it makes sense under
your domain’s business rules and invariants. For instance, to use the same example, if for any reason
(retry logic, hacking, etc.) the same CreateOrder command reaches your system multiple times, you
should be able to identify it and ensure that you do not create multiple orders. To do so, you need to
272 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


attach some kind of identity in the operations and identify whether the command or update was
already processed.
You send a command to a single receiver; you do not publish a command. Publishing is for events
that state a fact—that something has happened and might be interesting for event receivers. In the
case of events, the publisher has no concerns about which receivers get the event or what they do it.
But domain or integration events are a different story already introduced in previous sections.
A command is implemented with a class that contains data fields or collections with all the
information that is needed in order to execute that command. A command is a special kind of Data
Transfer Object (DTO), one that is specifically used to request changes or transactions. The command
itself is based on exactly the information that is needed for processing the command, and nothing
more.
The following example shows the simplified CreateOrderCommand class. This is an immutable
command that is used in the ordering microservice in eShopOnContainers.
// DDD and CQRS patterns comment: Note that it is recommended to implement immutable
Commands
// In this case, its immutability is achieved by having all the setters as private
// plus only being able to update the data just once, when creating the object through its
constructor.

Basically, the command class contains all the data you need for performing a business transaction by
using the domain model objects. Thus, commands are simply data structures that contain read-only
data, and no behavior. The command’s name indicates its purpose. In many languages like C#,
commands are represented as classes, but they are not true classes in the real object-oriented sense.
As an additional characteristic, commands are immutable, because the expected usage is that they are
processed directly by the domain model. They do not need to change during their projected lifetime.
In a C# class, immutability can be achieved by not having any setters or other methods that change
the internal state.
Keep in mind that if you intend or expect commands to go through a serializing/deserializing process,
the properties must have a private setter, and the [DataMember] (or [JsonProperty]) attribute.
Otherwise, the deserializer won’t be able to reconstruct the object at the destination with the required
values. You can also use truly read-only properties if the class has a constructor with parameters for all
properties, with the usual camelCase naming convention, and annotate the constructor as
[JsonConstructor]. However, this option requires more code.
For example, the command class for creating an order is probably similar in terms of data to the order
you want to create, but you probably do not need the same attributes. For instance,
CreateOrderCommand does not have an order ID, because the order has not been created yet.
Many command classes can be simple, requiring only a few fields about some state that needs to be
changed. That would be the case if you are just changing the status of an order from “in process” to
“paid” or “shipped” by using a command similar to the following:
[DataContract]
public class UpdateOrderStatusCommand
:IRequest<bool>
{
[DataMember]
public string Status { get; private set; }
[DataMember]
public string OrderId { get; private set; }
[DataMember]
public string BuyerIdentityGuid { get; private set; }
}
Some developers make their UI request objects separate from their command DTOs, but that is just a
matter of preference. It is a tedious separation with not much additional value, and the objects are
almost exactly the same shape. For instance, in eShopOnContainers, some commands come directly
from the client-side.
The Command handler class
You should implement a specific command handler class for each command. That is how the pattern
works, and it’s where you’ll use the command object, the domain objects, and the infrastructure
repository objects. The command handler is in fact the heart of the application layer in terms of CQRS
and DDD. However, all the domain logic should be contained in the domain classes—within the
aggregate roots (root entities), child entities, or domain services, but not within the command handler,
which is a class from the application layer.
275 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


---

The command handler class offers a strong stepping stone in the way to achieve the Single
Responsibility Principle (SRP) mentioned in a previous section.
A command handler receives a command and obtains a result from the aggregate that is used. The
result should be either successful execution of the command, or an exception. In the case of an
exception, the system state should be unchanged.
The command handler usually takes the following steps:
• It receives the command object, like a DTO (from the mediator or other infrastructure object).
• It validates that the command is valid (if not validated by the mediator).
• It instantiates the aggregate root instance that is the target of the current command.
• It executes the method on the aggregate root instance, getting the required data from the
command.
• It persists the new state of the aggregate to its related database. This last operation is the
actual transaction.
Typically, a command handler deals with a single aggregate driven by its aggregate root (root entity).
If multiple aggregates should be impacted by the reception of a single command, you could use
domain events to propagate states or actions across multiple aggregates.
The important point here is that when a command is being processed, all the domain logic should be
inside the domain model (the aggregates), fully encapsulated and ready for unit testing. The
command handler just acts as a way to get the domain model from the database, and as the final
step, to tell the infrastructure layer (repositories) to persist the changes when the model is changed.
The advantage of this approach is that you can refactor the domain logic in an isolated, fully
encapsulated, rich, behavioral domain model without changing code in the application or
infrastructure layers, which are the plumbing level (command handlers, Web API, repositories, etc.).
When command handlers get complex, with too much logic, that can be a code smell. Review them,
and if you find domain logic, refactor the code to move that domain behavior to the methods of the
domain objects (the aggregate root and child entity).
As an example of a command handler class, the following code shows the same
CreateOrderCommandHandler class that you saw at the beginning of this chapter. In this case, it also
highlights the Handle method and the operations with the domain model objects/aggregates.
public class CreateOrderCommandHandler
: IRequestHandler<CreateOrderCommand, bool>
{
private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;
private readonly IIdentityService _identityService;
private readonly IMediator _mediator;
private readonly IOrderingIntegrationEventService _orderingIntegrationEventService;
private readonly ILogger<CreateOrderCommandHandler> _logger;
// Using DI to inject infrastructure persistence Repositories
public CreateOrderCommandHandler(IMediator mediator,
IOrderingIntegrationEventService orderingIntegrationEventService,
IOrderRepository orderRepository,
276 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

IIdentityService identityService,
ILogger<CreateOrderCommandHandler> logger)
{
_orderRepository = orderRepository ?? throw new
ArgumentNullException(nameof(orderRepository));
_identityService = identityService ?? throw new
ArgumentNullException(nameof(identityService));
_mediator = mediator ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(mediator));
_orderingIntegrationEventService = orderingIntegrationEventService ?? throw new
ArgumentNullException(nameof(orderingIntegrationEventService));
_logger = logger ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(logger));
}
public async Task<bool> Handle(CreateOrderCommand message, CancellationToken
cancellationToken)
{
// Add Integration event to clean the basket
var orderStartedIntegrationEvent = new
OrderStartedIntegrationEvent(message.UserId);
await
_orderingIntegrationEventService.AddAndSaveEventAsync(orderStartedIntegrationEvent);
// Add/Update the Buyer AggregateRoot
// DDD patterns comment: Add child entities and value-objects through the Order
Aggregate-Root
// methods and constructor so validations, invariants and business logic
// make sure that consistency is preserved across the whole aggregate
var address = new Address(message.Street, message.City, message.State,
message.Country, message.ZipCode);
var order = new Order(message.UserId, message.UserName, address,
message.CardTypeId, message.CardNumber, message.CardSecurityNumber, message.CardHolderName,
message.CardExpiration);
foreach (var item in message.OrderItems)
{
order.AddOrderItem(item.ProductId, item.ProductName, item.UnitPrice,
item.Discount, item.PictureUrl, item.Units);
}
_logger.LogInformation("----- Creating Order - Order: {@Order}", order);
_orderRepository.Add(order);
return await _orderRepository.UnitOfWork
.SaveEntitiesAsync(cancellationToken);
}
}
These are additional steps a command handler should take:
• Use the command’s data to operate with the aggregate root’s methods and behavior.
• Internally within the domain objects, raise domain events while the transaction is executed,
but that is transparent from a command handler point of view.
• If the aggregate’s operation result is successful and after the transaction is finished, raise
integration events. (These might also be raised by infrastructure classes like repositories.)

The Command process pipeline: how to trigger a command handler
The next question is how to invoke a command handler. You could manually call it from each related
ASP.NET Core controller. However, that approach would be too coupled and is not ideal.
The other two main options, which are the recommended options, are:
• Through an in-memory Mediator pattern artifact.
• With an asynchronous message queue, in between controllers and handlers.
Use the Mediator pattern (in-memory) in the command pipeline
As shown in Figure 7-25, in a CQRS approach you use an intelligent mediator, similar to an in-memory
bus, which is smart enough to redirect to the right command handler based on the type of the
command or DTO being received. The single black arrows between components represent the
dependencies between objects (in many cases, injected through DI) with their related interactions.
278 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

Figure 7-25. Using the Mediator pattern in process in a single CQRS microservice
The above diagram shows a zoom-in from image 7-24: the ASP.NET Core controller sends the
command to MediatR’s command pipeline, so they get to the appropriate handler.
The reason that using the Mediator pattern makes sense is that in enterprise applications, the
processing requests can get complicated. You want to be able to add an open number of cross-
cutting concerns like logging, validations, audit, and security. In these cases, you can rely on a
mediator pipeline (see Mediator pattern) to provide a means for these extra behaviors or cross-
cutting concerns.
A mediator is an object that encapsulates the “how” of this process: it coordinates execution based on
state, the way a command handler is invoked, or the payload you provide to the handler. With a
mediator component, you can apply cross-cutting concerns in a centralized and transparent way by
applying decorators (or pipeline behaviors since MediatR 3). For more information, see the Decorator
pattern.
Decorators and behaviors are similar to Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP), only applied to a
specific process pipeline managed by the mediator component. Aspects in AOP that implement cross-
cutting concerns are applied based on aspect weavers injected at compilation time or based on object
call interception. Both typical AOP approaches are sometimes said to work “like magic,” because it is
not easy to see how AOP does its work. When dealing with serious issues or bugs, AOP can be difficult
to debug. On the other hand, these decorators/behaviors are explicit and applied only in the context
of the mediator, so debugging is much more predictable and easy.
For example, in the eShopOnContainers ordering microservice, has an implementation of two sample
behaviors, a LogBehavior class and a ValidatorBehavior class. The implementation of the behaviors is
explained in the next section by showing how eShopOnContainers uses MediatR behaviors.
279 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


Use message queues (out-of-proc) in the command’s pipeline
Another choice is to use asynchronous messages based on brokers or message queues, as shown in
Figure 7-26. That option could also be combined with the mediator component right before the
command handler.
Figure 7-26. Using message queues (out of the process and inter-process communication) with CQRS commands
Command’s pipeline can also be handled by a high availability message queue to deliver the
commands to the appropriate handler. Using message queues to accept the commands can further
complicate your command’s pipeline, because you will probably need to split the pipeline into two
processes connected through the external message queue. Still, it should be used if you need to have
improved scalability and performance based on asynchronous messaging. Consider that in the case of
Figure 7-26, the controller just posts the command message into the queue and returns. Then the
command handlers process the messages at their own pace. That is a great benefit of queues: the
message queue can act as a buffer in cases when hyper scalability is needed, such as for stocks or any
other scenario with a high volume of ingress data.
However, because of the asynchronous nature of message queues, you need to figure out how to
communicate with the client application about the success or failure of the command’s process. As a
rule, you should never use “fire and forget” commands. Every business application needs to know if a
command was processed successfully, or at least validated and accepted.
Thus, being able to respond to the client after validating a command message that was submitted to
an asynchronous queue adds complexity to your system, as compared to an in-process command
process that returns the operation’s result after running the transaction. Using queues, you might
need to return the result of the command process through other operation result messages, which will
require additional components and custom communication in your system.
280 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns


Additionally, async commands are one-way commands, which in many cases might not be needed, as
is explained in the following interesting exchange between Burtsev Alexey and Greg Young in an
online conversation:
[Burtsev Alexey] I find lots of code where people use async command handling or one-way command
messaging without any reason to do so (they are not doing some long operation, they are not
executing external async code, they do not even cross-application boundary to be using message
bus). Why do they introduce this unnecessary complexity? And actually, I haven’t seen a CQRS code
example with blocking command handlers so far, though it will work just fine in most cases.
[Greg Young] […] an asynchronous command doesn’t exist; it’s actually another event. If I must accept
what you send me and raise an event if I disagree, it’s no longer you telling me to do something [that
is, it’s not a command]. It’s you telling me something has been done. This seems like a slight
difference at first, but it has many implications.
Asynchronous commands greatly increase the complexity of a system, because there is no simple way
to indicate failures. Therefore, asynchronous commands are not recommended other than when
scaling requirements are needed or in special cases when communicating the internal microservices
through messaging. In those cases, you must design a separate reporting and recovery system for
failures.
In the initial version of eShopOnContainers, it was decided to use synchronous command processing,
started from HTTP requests and driven by the Mediator pattern. That easily allows you to return the
success or failure of the process, as in the CreateOrderCommandHandler implementation.
In any case, this should be a decision based on your application’s or microservice’s business
requirements.
Implement the command process pipeline with a mediator pattern
(MediatR)
As a sample implementation, this guide proposes using the in-process pipeline based on the Mediator
pattern to drive command ingestion and route commands, in memory, to the right command
handlers. The guide also proposes applying behaviors in order to separate cross-cutting concerns.
For implementation in .NET, there are multiple open-source libraries available that implement the
Mediator pattern. The library used in this guide is the MediatR open-source library (created by Jimmy
Bogard), but you could use another approach. MediatR is a small and simple library that allows you to
process in-memory messages like a command, while applying decorators or behaviors.
Using the Mediator pattern helps you to reduce coupling and to isolate the concerns of the requested
work, while automatically connecting to the handler that performs that work—in this case, to
command handlers.
Another good reason to use the Mediator pattern was explained by Jimmy Bogard when reviewing
this guide:
281 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

I think it might be worth mentioning testing here – it provides a nice consistent window into the
behavior of your system. Request-in, response-out. We’ve found that aspect quite valuable in building
consistently behaving tests.
First, let’s look at a sample WebAPI controller where you actually would use the mediator object. If
you weren’t using the mediator object, you’d need to inject all the dependencies for that controller,
things like a logger object and others. Therefore, the constructor would be complicated. On the other
hand, if you use the mediator object, the constructor of your controller can be a lot simpler, with just a
few dependencies instead of many dependencies if you had one per cross-cutting operation, as in the
following example:
public class MyMicroserviceController : Controller
{
public MyMicroserviceController(IMediator mediator,
IMyMicroserviceQueries microserviceQueries)
{
// ...
}
}
You can see that the mediator provides a clean and lean Web API controller constructor. In addition,
within the controller methods, the code to send a command to the mediator object is almost one line:
[Route("new")]
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> ExecuteBusinessOperation([FromBody]RunOpCommand
runOperationCommand)
{
var commandResult = await _mediator.SendAsync(runOperationCommand);
return commandResult ? (IActionResult)Ok() : (IActionResult)BadRequest();
}
Implement idempotent Commands
In eShopOnContainers, a more advanced example than the above is submitting a
CreateOrderCommand object from the Ordering microservice. But since the Ordering business
process is a bit more complex and, in our case, it actually starts in the Basket microservice, this action
of submitting the CreateOrderCommand object is performed from an integration-event handler
named UserCheckoutAcceptedIntegrationEventHandler instead of a simple WebAPI controller called
from the client App as in the previous simpler example.
Nevertheless, the action of submitting the Command to MediatR is pretty similar, as shown in the
following code.
var createOrderCommand = new CreateOrderCommand(eventMsg.Basket.Items,
eventMsg.UserId, eventMsg.City,
eventMsg.Street, eventMsg.State,
eventMsg.Country, eventMsg.ZipCode,
eventMsg.CardNumber,
eventMsg.CardHolderName,
eventMsg.CardExpiration,
eventMsg.CardSecurityNumber,
eventMsg.CardTypeId);
282 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

var requestCreateOrder = new IdentifiedCommand<CreateOrderCommand,bool>(createOrderCommand,
eventMsg.RequestId);
result = await _mediator.Send(requestCreateOrder);
However, this case is also slightly more advanced because we’re also implementing idempotent
commands. The CreateOrderCommand process should be idempotent, so if the same message comes
duplicated through the network, because of any reason, like retries, the same business order will be
processed just once.
This is implemented by wrapping the business command (in this case CreateOrderCommand) and
embedding it into a generic IdentifiedCommand, which is tracked by an ID of every message coming
through the network that has to be idempotent.
In the code below, you can see that the IdentifiedCommand is nothing more than a DTO with and ID
plus the wrapped business command object.
public class IdentifiedCommand<T, R> : IRequest<R>
where T : IRequest<R>
{
public T Command { get; }
public Guid Id { get; }
public IdentifiedCommand(T command, Guid id)
{
Command = command;
Id = id;
}
}
Then the CommandHandler for the IdentifiedCommand named IdentifiedCommandHandler.cs will
basically check if the ID coming as part of the message already exists in a table. If it already exists, that
command won’t be processed again, so it behaves as an idempotent command. That infrastructure
code is performed by the _requestManager.ExistAsync method call below.
// IdentifiedCommandHandler.cs
public class IdentifiedCommandHandler<T, R> : IRequestHandler<IdentifiedCommand<T, R>, R>
where T : IRequest<R>
{
private readonly IMediator _mediator;
private readonly IRequestManager _requestManager;
private readonly ILogger<IdentifiedCommandHandler<T, R>> _logger;
public IdentifiedCommandHandler(
IMediator mediator,
IRequestManager requestManager,
ILogger<IdentifiedCommandHandler<T, R>> logger)
{
_mediator = mediator;
_requestManager = requestManager;
_logger = logger ?? throw new System.ArgumentNullException(nameof(logger));
}

{
var alreadyExists = await _requestManager.ExistAsync(message.Id);
if (alreadyExists)
{
return CreateResultForDuplicateRequest();
}
else
{
await _requestManager.CreateRequestForCommandAsync<T>(message.Id);
try
{
var command = message.Command;
var commandName = command.GetGenericTypeName();
var idProperty = string.Empty;
var commandId = string.Empty;
switch (command)
{
case CreateOrderCommand createOrderCommand:
idProperty = nameof(createOrderCommand.UserId);
commandId = createOrderCommand.UserId;
break;
case CancelOrderCommand cancelOrderCommand:
idProperty = nameof(cancelOrderCommand.OrderNumber);
commandId = $"{cancelOrderCommand.OrderNumber}";
break;
case ShipOrderCommand shipOrderCommand:
idProperty = nameof(shipOrderCommand.OrderNumber);
commandId = $"{shipOrderCommand.OrderNumber}";
break;
default:
idProperty = "Id?";
commandId = "n/a";
break;
}
_logger.LogInformation(

284 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

command);
// Send the embedded business command to mediator so it runs its related

var result = await _mediator.Send(command, cancellationToken);
_logger.LogInformation(
"----- Command result: {@Result} - {CommandName} - {IdProperty}:

result,
commandName,
idProperty,
commandId,
command);
return result;
}
catch
{
return default(R);
}
}
}
}
Since the IdentifiedCommand acts like a business command’s envelope, when the business command
needs to be processed because it is not a repeated ID, then it takes that inner business command and
resubmits it to Mediator, as in the last part of the code shown above when running
_mediator.Send(message.Command), from the IdentifiedCommandHandler.cs.
When doing that, it will link and run the business command handler, in this case, the
CreateOrderCommandHandler, which is running transactions against the Ordering database, as shown
in the following code.
// CreateOrderCommandHandler.cs
public class CreateOrderCommandHandler
: IRequestHandler<CreateOrderCommand, bool>
{
private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;
private readonly IIdentityService _identityService;
private readonly IMediator _mediator;
private readonly IOrderingIntegrationEventService _orderingIntegrationEventService;
private readonly ILogger<CreateOrderCommandHandler> _logger;
// Using DI to inject infrastructure persistence Repositories
public CreateOrderCommandHandler(IMediator mediator,
IOrderingIntegrationEventService orderingIntegrationEventService,
IOrderRepository orderRepository,
IIdentityService identityService,
ILogger<CreateOrderCommandHandler> logger)
{
_orderRepository = orderRepository ?? throw new
ArgumentNullException(nameof(orderRepository));
_identityService = identityService ?? throw new
ArgumentNullException(nameof(identityService));
_mediator = mediator ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(mediator));
_orderingIntegrationEventService = orderingIntegrationEventService ?? throw new

}
_logger.LogInformation("----- Creating Order - Order: {@Order}", order);
_orderRepository.Add(order);
return await _orderRepository.UnitOfWork
.SaveEntitiesAsync(cancellationToken);
}
}
Register the types used by MediatR
In order for MediatR to be aware of your command handler classes, you need to register the mediator
classes and the command handler classes in your IoC container. By default, MediatR uses Autofac as
the IoC container, but you can also use the built-in ASP.NET Core IoC container or any other container
supported by MediatR.
The following code shows how to register Mediator’s types and commands when using Autofac
modules.
public class MediatorModule : Autofac.Module
{
protected override void Load(ContainerBuilder builder)
{
builder.RegisterAssemblyTypes(typeof(IMediator).GetTypeInfo().Assembly)
.AsImplementedInterfaces();
// Register all the Command classes (they implement IRequestHandler)
// in assembly holding the Commands
builder.RegisterAssemblyTypes(typeof(CreateOrderCommand).GetTypeInfo().Assembly)
.AsClosedTypesOf(typeof(IRequestHandler<,>));
// Other types registration
286 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

//...
}
}
This is where “the magic happens” with MediatR.
As each command handler implements the generic IRequestHandler<T> interface, when you register
the assemblies using RegisteredAssemblyTypes method all the types marked as IRequestHandler also
gets registered with their Commands. For example:
public class CreateOrderCommandHandler
: IRequestHandler<CreateOrderCommand, bool>
{
That is the code that correlates commands with command handlers. The handler is just a simple class,
but it inherits from RequestHandler<T>, where T is the command type, and MediatR makes sure it is
invoked with the correct payload (the command).
Apply cross-cutting concerns when processing commands with the
Behaviors in MediatR
There is one more thing: being able to apply cross-cutting concerns to the mediator pipeline. You can
also see at the end of the Autofac registration module code how it registers a behavior type,
specifically, a custom LoggingBehavior class and a ValidatorBehavior class. But you could add other
custom behaviors, too.
public class MediatorModule : Autofac.Module
{
protected override void Load(ContainerBuilder builder)
{
builder.RegisterAssemblyTypes(typeof(IMediator).GetTypeInfo().Assembly)
.AsImplementedInterfaces();
// Register all the Command classes (they implement IRequestHandler)
// in assembly holding the Commands
builder.RegisterAssemblyTypes(
typeof(CreateOrderCommand).GetTypeInfo().Assembly).
AsClosedTypesOf(typeof(IRequestHandler<,>));
// Other types registration
//...
builder.RegisterGeneric(typeof(LoggingBehavior<,>)).
As(typeof(IPipelineBehavior<,>));
builder.RegisterGeneric(typeof(ValidatorBehavior<,>)).
As(typeof(IPipelineBehavior<,>));
}
}
That LoggingBehavior class can be implemented as the following code, which logs information about
the command handler being executed and whether it was successful or not.
public class LoggingBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>
: IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>
{
private readonly ILogger<LoggingBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>> _logger;
public LoggingBehavior(ILogger<LoggingBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>> logger) =>
_logger = logger;
287 CHAPTER 6 | Tackle Business Complexity in a Microservice with DDD and CQRS Patterns

public async Task<TResponse> Handle(TRequest request,
RequestHandlerDelegate<TResponse> next)
{
_logger.LogInformation($"Handling {typeof(TRequest).Name}");
var response = await next();
_logger.LogInformation($"Handled {typeof(TResponse).Name}");
return response;
}
}
Just by implementing this behavior class and by registering it in the pipeline (in the MediatorModule
above), all the commands processed through MediatR will be logging information about the
execution.
The eShopOnContainers ordering microservice also applies a second behavior for basic validations,
the ValidatorBehavior class that relies on the FluentValidation library, as shown in the following code:
public class ValidatorBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>
: IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>
{
private readonly IValidator<TRequest>[] _validators;
public ValidatorBehavior(IValidator<TRequest>[] validators) =>
_validators = validators;
public async Task<TResponse> Handle(TRequest request,
RequestHandlerDelegate<TResponse> next)
{
var failures = _validators
.Select(v => v.Validate(request))
.SelectMany(result => result.Errors)
.Where(error => error != null)
.ToList();
if (failures.Any())
{
throw new OrderingDomainException(
$"Command Validation Errors for type {typeof(TRequest).Name}",
new ValidationException("Validation exception", failures));
}
var response = await next();
return response;
}
}
Here the behavior is raising an exception if validation fails, but you could also return a result object,
containing the command result if it succeeded or the validation messages in case it didn’t. This would
probably make it easier to display validation results to the user.
Then, based on the FluentValidation library, you would create validation for the data passed with
CreateOrderCommand, as in the following code:
public class CreateOrderCommandValidator : AbstractValidator<CreateOrderCommand>
{

RuleFor(command => command.Country).NotEmpty();
RuleFor(command => command.ZipCode).NotEmpty();
RuleFor(command => command.CardNumber).NotEmpty().Length(12, 19);

}
private bool BeValidExpirationDate(DateTime dateTime)
{
return dateTime >= DateTime.UtcNow;
}
private bool ContainOrderItems(IEnumerable<OrderItemDTO> orderItems)
{
return orderItems.Any();
}
}
You could create additional validations. This is a very clean and elegant way to implement your
command validations.
In a similar way, you could implement other behaviors for additional aspects or cross-cutting concerns
that you want to apply to commands when handling them.

CHAPTER
Implement resilient
applications
Your microservice and cloud-based applications must embrace the partial failures that will certainly
occur eventually. You must design your application to be resilient to those partial failures.
Resiliency is the ability to recover from failures and continue to function. It isn’t about avoiding
failures but accepting the fact that failures will happen and responding to them in a way that avoids
downtime or data loss. The goal of resiliency is to return the application to a fully functioning state
after a failure.
It’s challenging enough to design and deploy a microservices-based application. But you also need to
keep your application running in an environment where some sort of failure is certain. Therefore, your
application should be resilient. It should be designed to cope with partial failures, like network
outages or nodes or VMs crashing in the cloud. Even microservices (containers) being moved to a
different node within a cluster can cause intermittent short failures within the application.
The many individual components of your application should also incorporate health monitoring
features. By following the guidelines in this chapter, you can create an application that can work
smoothly in spite of transient downtime or the normal hiccups that occur in complex and cloud-based
deployments.
Important
eShopOnContainer had been using the Polly library to implement resiliency using Typed Clients up
until the release 3.0.0.
Starting with release 3.0.0, the HTTP calls resiliency is implemented using a Linkerd mesh, that handles
retries in a transparent and configurable fashion, within a Kubernetes cluster, without having to
handle those concerns in the code.
The Polly library is still used to add resilience to database connections, specially while starting up the
services.
Warning
All code samples and images in this section were valid before using Linkerd and are not updated to
reflect the current actual code. So they make sense in the context of this section.
291 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

Handle partial failure
In distributed systems like microservices-based applications, there’s an ever-present risk of partial
failure. For instance, a single microservice/container can fail or might not be available to respond for a
short time, or a single VM or server can crash. Since clients and services are separate processes, a
service might not be able to respond in a timely way to a client’s request. The service might be
overloaded and responding very slowly to requests or might simply not be accessible for a short time
because of network issues.
For example, consider the Order details page from the eShopOnContainers sample application. If the
ordering microservice is unresponsive when the user tries to submit an order, a bad implementation
of the client process (the MVC web application)—for example, if the client code were to use
synchronous RPCs with no timeout—would block threads indefinitely waiting for a response. Besides
creating a bad user experience, every unresponsive wait consumes or blocks a thread, and threads are
extremely valuable in highly scalable applications. If there are many blocked threads, eventually the
application’s runtime can run out of threads. In that case, the application can become globally
unresponsive instead of just partially unresponsive, as shown in Figure 8-1.
Figure 8-1. Partial failures because of dependencies that impact service thread availability
In a large microservices-based application, any partial failure can be amplified, especially if most of
the internal microservices interaction is based on synchronous HTTP calls (which is considered an anti-
pattern). Think about a system that receives millions of incoming calls per day. If your system has a
bad design that’s based on long chains of synchronous HTTP calls, these incoming calls might result in
many more millions of outgoing calls (let’s suppose a ratio of 1:4) to dozens of internal microservices
as synchronous dependencies. This situation is shown in Figure 8-2, especially dependency #3, that
starts a chain, calling dependency #4, which then calls #5.
292 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications


Figure 8-2. The impact of having an incorrect design featuring long chains of HTTP requests
Intermittent failure is guaranteed in a distributed and cloud-based system, even if every dependency
itself has excellent availability. It’s a fact you need to consider.
If you do not design and implement techniques to ensure fault tolerance, even small downtimes can
be amplified. As an example, 50 dependencies each with 99.99% of availability would result in several
hours of downtime each month because of this ripple effect. When a microservice dependency fails
while handling a high volume of requests, that failure can quickly saturate all available request threads
in each service and crash the whole application.
Figure 8-3. Partial failure amplified by microservices with long chains of synchronous HTTP calls
293 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications



To minimize this problem, in the section Asynchronous microservice integration enforce microservice’s
autonomy, this guide encourages you to use asynchronous communication across the internal
microservices.
In addition, it’s essential that you design your microservices and client applications to handle partial
failures—that is, to build resilient microservices and client applications.
Strategies to handle partial failure
To deal with partial failures, use one of the strategies described here.
Use asynchronous communication (for example, message-based communication) across
internal microservices. It’s highly advisable not to create long chains of synchronous HTTP calls
across the internal microservices because that incorrect design will eventually become the main cause
of bad outages. On the contrary, except for the front-end communications between the client
applications and the first level of microservices or fine-grained API Gateways, it’s recommended to use
only asynchronous (message-based) communication once past the initial request/response cycle,
across the internal microservices. Eventual consistency and event-driven architectures will help to
minimize ripple effects. These approaches enforce a higher level of microservice autonomy and
therefore prevent against the problem noted here.
Use retries with exponential backoff. This technique helps to avoid short and intermittent failures
by performing call retries a certain number of times, in case the service was not available only for a
short time. This might occur due to intermittent network issues or when a microservice/container is
moved to a different node in a cluster. However, if these retries are not designed properly with circuit
breakers, it can aggravate the ripple effects, ultimately even causing a Denial of Service (DoS).
Work around network timeouts. In general, clients should be designed not to block indefinitely and
to always use timeouts when waiting for a response. Using timeouts ensures that resources are never
tied up indefinitely.
Use the Circuit Breaker pattern. In this approach, the client process tracks the number of failed
requests. If the error rate exceeds a configured limit, a “circuit breaker” trips so that further attempts
fail immediately. (If a large number of requests are failing, that suggests the service is unavailable and
that sending requests is pointless.) After a timeout period, the client should try again and, if the new
requests are successful, close the circuit breaker.
Provide fallbacks. In this approach, the client process performs fallback logic when a request fails,
such as returning cached data or a default value. This is an approach suitable for queries, and is more
complex for updates or commands.
Limit the number of queued requests. Clients should also impose an upper bound on the number
of outstanding requests that a client microservice can send to a particular service. If the limit has been
reached, it’s probably pointless to make additional requests, and those attempts should fail
immediately. In terms of implementation, the Polly Bulkhead Isolation policy can be used to fulfill this
requirement. This approach is essentially a parallelization throttle with SemaphoreSlim as the
implementation. It also permits a “queue” outside the bulkhead. You can proactively shed excess load
even before execution (for example, because capacity is deemed full). This makes its response to
294 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

certain failure scenarios faster than a circuit breaker would be, since the circuit breaker waits for the
failures. The BulkheadPolicy object in Polly exposes how full the bulkhead and queue are, and offers
events on overflow so can also be used to drive automated horizontal scaling.

Implement retries with exponential backoff
Retries with exponential backoff is a technique that retries an operation, with an exponentially
increasing wait time, up to a maximum retry count has been reached (the exponential backoff). This
technique embraces the fact that cloud resources might intermittently be unavailable for more than a
few seconds for any reason. For example, an orchestrator might be moving a container to another
node in a cluster for load balancing. During that time, some requests might fail. Another example
could be a database like SQL Azure, where a database can be moved to another server for load
balancing, causing the database to be unavailable for a few seconds.
There are many approaches to implement retries logic with exponential backoff.
Implement resilient Entity Framework Core SQL
connections
For Azure SQL DB, Entity Framework (EF) Core already provides internal database connection resiliency
and retry logic. But you need to enable the Entity Framework execution strategy for each DbContext
connection if you want to have resilient EF Core connections.
For instance, the following code at the EF Core connection level enables resilient SQL connections that
are retried if the connection fails.
// Program.cs from any ASP.NET Core Web API
// Other code ...
builder.Services.AddDbContext<CatalogContext>(options =>
{
295 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications


---

options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration["ConnectionString"],
sqlServerOptionsAction: sqlOptions =>
{
sqlOptions.EnableRetryOnFailure(
maxRetryCount: 10,
maxRetryDelay: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30),
errorNumbersToAdd: null);
});
});
Execution strategies and explicit transactions using BeginTransaction
and multiple DbContexts
When retries are enabled in EF Core connections, each operation you perform using EF Core becomes
its own retryable operation. Each query and each call to SaveChanges will be retried as a unit if a
transient failure occurs.
However, if your code initiates a transaction using BeginTransaction, you’re defining your own group
of operations that need to be treated as a unit. Everything inside the transaction has to be rolled back
if a failure occurs.
If you try to execute that transaction when using an EF execution strategy (retry policy) and you call
SaveChanges from multiple DbContexts, you’ll get an exception like this one:
System.InvalidOperationException: The configured execution strategy
‘SqlServerRetryingExecutionStrategy’ does not support user initiated transactions. Use the execution
strategy returned by ‘DbContext.Database.CreateExecutionStrategy()’ to execute all the operations in
the transaction as a retriable unit.
The solution is to manually invoke the EF execution strategy with a delegate representing everything
that needs to be executed. If a transient failure occurs, the execution strategy will invoke the delegate
again. For example, the following code shows how it’s implemented in eShopOnContainers with two
multiple DbContexts (_catalogContext and the IntegrationEventLogContext) when updating a product
and then saving the ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent object, which needs to use a different
DbContext.
public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateProduct(
[FromBody]CatalogItem productToUpdate)
{
// Other code ...
var oldPrice = catalogItem.Price;
var raiseProductPriceChangedEvent = oldPrice != productToUpdate.Price;
// Update current product
catalogItem = productToUpdate;
// Save product's data and publish integration event through the Event Bus
// if price has changed
if (raiseProductPriceChangedEvent)
{
//Create Integration Event to be published through the Event Bus
var priceChangedEvent = new ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent(
catalogItem.Id, productToUpdate.Price, oldPrice);
296 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

// Achieving atomicity between original Catalog database operation and the
// IntegrationEventLog thanks to a local transaction
await _catalogIntegrationEventService.SaveEventAndCatalogContextChangesAsync(
priceChangedEvent);
// Publish through the Event Bus and mark the saved event as published
await _catalogIntegrationEventService.PublishThroughEventBusAsync(
priceChangedEvent);
}
// Just save the updated product because the Product's Price hasn't changed.
else
{
await _catalogContext.SaveChangesAsync();
}
}
The first DbContext is _catalogContext and the second DbContext is within the
_catalogIntegrationEventService object. The Commit action is performed across all DbContext objects
using an EF execution strategy.
To achieve this multiple DbContext commit, the SaveEventAndCatalogContextChangesAsync uses a
ResilientTransaction class, as shown in the following code:
public class CatalogIntegrationEventService : ICatalogIntegrationEventService
{
//…
public async Task SaveEventAndCatalogContextChangesAsync(
IntegrationEvent evt)
{
// Use of an EF Core resiliency strategy when using multiple DbContexts
// within an explicit BeginTransaction():
// https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/miscellaneous/connection-resiliency
await ResilientTransaction.New(_catalogContext).ExecuteAsync(async () =>
{
// Achieving atomicity between original catalog database
// operation and the IntegrationEventLog thanks to a local transaction
await _catalogContext.SaveChangesAsync();
await _eventLogService.SaveEventAsync(evt,
_catalogContext.Database.CurrentTransaction.GetDbTransaction());
});
}
}
The ResilientTransaction.ExecuteAsync method basically begins a transaction from the passed
DbContext (_catalogContext) and then makes the EventLogService use that transaction to save
changes from the IntegrationEventLogContext and then commits the whole transaction.
public class ResilientTransaction
{
private DbContext _context;
private ResilientTransaction(DbContext context) =>
_context = context ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
public static ResilientTransaction New (DbContext context) =>
new ResilientTransaction(context);
public async Task ExecuteAsync(Func<Task> action)
{
297 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

// Use of an EF Core resiliency strategy when using multiple DbContexts
// within an explicit BeginTransaction():
// https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/miscellaneous/connection-resiliency
var strategy = _context.Database.CreateExecutionStrategy();
await strategy.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
{
await using var transaction = await _context.Database.BeginTransactionAsync();
await action();
await transaction.CommitAsync();
});
}
}

Use IHttpClientFactory to implement resilient HTTP
requests
IHttpClientFactory is a contract implemented by DefaultHttpClientFactory, an opinionated factory,
available since .NET Core 2.1, for creating HttpClient instances to be used in your applications.
Issues with the original HttpClient class available in .NET
The original and well-known HttpClient class can be easily used, but in some cases, it isn’t being
properly used by many developers.
Though this class implements IDisposable, declaring and instantiating it within a using statement is
not preferred because when the HttpClient object gets disposed of, the underlying socket is not
immediately released, which can lead to a socket exhaustion problem. For more information about this
issue, see the blog post You’re using HttpClient wrong and it’s destabilizing your software.
Therefore, HttpClient is intended to be instantiated once and reused throughout the life of an
application. Instantiating an HttpClient class for every request will exhaust the number of sockets
available under heavy loads. That issue will result in SocketException errors. Possible approaches to
solve that problem are based on the creation of the HttpClient object as singleton or static, as
explained in this Microsoft article on HttpClient usage. This can be a good solution for short-lived
console apps or similar, that run a few times a day.
298 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

Another issue that developers run into is when using a shared instance of HttpClient in long-running
processes. In a situation where the HttpClient is instantiated as a singleton or a static object, it fails to
handle the DNS changes as described in this issue of the dotnet/runtime GitHub repository.
However, the issue isn’t really with HttpClient per se, but with the default constructor for HttpClient,
because it creates a new concrete instance of HttpMessageHandler, which is the one that has sockets
exhaustion and DNS changes issues mentioned above.
To address the issues mentioned above and to make HttpClient instances manageable, .NET Core 2.1
introduced two approaches, one of them being IHttpClientFactory. It’s an interface that’s used to
configure and create HttpClient instances in an app through Dependency Injection (DI). It also
provides extensions for Polly-based middleware to take advantage of delegating handlers in
HttpClient.
The alternative is to use SocketsHttpHandler with configured PooledConnectionLifetime. This
approach is applied to long-lived, static or singleton HttpClient instances. To learn more about
different strategies, see HttpClient guidelines for .NET.
Polly is a transient-fault-handling library that helps developers add resiliency to their applications, by
using some pre-defined policies in a fluent and thread-safe manner.
Benefits of using IHttpClientFactory
The current implementation of IHttpClientFactory, that also implements IHttpMessageHandlerFactory,
offers the following benefits:
• Provides a central location for naming and configuring logical HttpClient objects. For
example, you may configure a client (Service Agent) that’s pre-configured to access a specific
microservice.
• Codify the concept of outgoing middleware via delegating handlers in HttpClient and
implementing Polly-based middleware to take advantage of Polly’s policies for resiliency.
• HttpClient already has the concept of delegating handlers that could be linked together for
outgoing HTTP requests. You can register HTTP clients into the factory and you can use a
Polly handler to use Polly policies for Retry, CircuitBreakers, and so on.
• Manage the lifetime of HttpMessageHandler to avoid the mentioned problems/issues that
can occur when managing HttpClient lifetimes yourself.
Tip
The HttpClient instances injected by DI can be disposed of safely, because the associated
HttpMessageHandler is managed by the factory. Injected HttpClient instances are Transient from a DI
perspective, while HttpMessageHandler instances can be regarded as Scoped. HttpMessageHandler
instances have their own DI scopes, separate from the application scopes (for example, ASP.NET
incoming request scopes). For more information, see Using HttpClientFactory in .NET.
299 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

Note
The implementation of IHttpClientFactory (DefaultHttpClientFactory) is tightly tied to the DI
implementation in the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection NuGet package. If you need to use
HttpClient without DI or with other DI implementations, consider using a static or singleton HttpClient
with PooledConnectionLifetime set up. For more information, see HttpClient guidelines for .NET.
Multiple ways to use IHttpClientFactory
There are several ways that you can use IHttpClientFactory in your application:
• Basic usage
• Use Named Clients
• Use Typed Clients
• Use Generated Clients
For the sake of brevity, this guidance shows the most structured way to use IHttpClientFactory, which
is to use Typed Clients (Service Agent pattern). However, all options are documented and are currently
listed in this article covering the IHttpClientFactory usage.
Note
If your app requires cookies, it might be better to avoid using IHttpClientFactory in your app. For
alternative ways of managing clients, see Guidelines for using HTTP clients
How to use Typed Clients with IHttpClientFactory
So, what’s a “Typed Client”? It’s just an HttpClient that’s pre-configured for some specific use. This
configuration can include specific values such as the base server, HTTP headers or time outs.
The following diagram shows how Typed Clients are used with IHttpClientFactory:
300 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

Figure 8-4. Using IHttpClientFactory with Typed Client classes.
In the above image, a ClientService (used by a controller or client code) uses an HttpClient created by
the registered IHttpClientFactory. This factory assigns an HttpMessageHandler from a pool to the
HttpClient. The HttpClient can be configured with Polly’s policies when registering the
IHttpClientFactory in the DI container with the extension method AddHttpClient.
To configure the above structure, add IHttpClientFactory in your application by installing the
Microsoft.Extensions.Http NuGet package that includes the AddHttpClient extension method for
IServiceCollection. This extension method registers the internal DefaultHttpClientFactory class to be
used as a singleton for the interface IHttpClientFactory. It defines a transient configuration for the
HttpMessageHandlerBuilder. This message handler (HttpMessageHandler object), taken from a pool,
is used by the HttpClient returned from the factory.
In the next snippet, you can see how AddHttpClient() can be used to register Typed Clients (Service
Agents) that need to use HttpClient.
// Program.cs
//Add http client services at ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<ICatalogService, CatalogService>();
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<IBasketService, BasketService>();
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<IOrderingService, OrderingService>();
301 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications


Registering the client services as shown in the previous snippet, makes the DefaultClientFactory create
a standard HttpClient for each service. The typed client is registered as transient with DI container. In
the preceding code, AddHttpClient() registers CatalogService, BasketService, OrderingService as
transient services so they can be injected and consumed directly without any need for additional
registrations.
You could also add instance-specific configuration in the registration to, for example, configure the
base address, and add some resiliency policies, as shown in the following:
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<ICatalogService, CatalogService>(client =>
{
client.BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.Configuration["BaseUrl"]);
})
.AddPolicyHandler(GetRetryPolicy())
.AddPolicyHandler(GetCircuitBreakerPolicy());
In this next example, you can see the configuration of one of the above policies:
static IAsyncPolicy<HttpResponseMessage> GetRetryPolicy()
{
return HttpPolicyExtensions
.HandleTransientHttpError()
.OrResult(msg => msg.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.NotFound)
.WaitAndRetryAsync(6, retryAttempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2,
retryAttempt)));
}
You can find more details about using Polly in the Next article.
HttpClient lifetimes
Each time you get an HttpClient object from the IHttpClientFactory, a new instance is returned. But
each HttpClient uses an HttpMessageHandler that’s pooled and reused by the IHttpClientFactory to
reduce resource consumption, as long as the HttpMessageHandler’s lifetime hasn’t expired.
Pooling of handlers is desirable as each handler typically manages its own underlying HTTP
connections; creating more handlers than necessary can result in connection delays. Some handlers
also keep connections open indefinitely, which can prevent the handler from reacting to DNS
changes.
The HttpMessageHandler objects in the pool have a lifetime that’s the length of time that an
HttpMessageHandler instance in the pool can be reused. The default value is two minutes, but it can
be overridden per Typed Client. To override it, call SetHandlerLifetime() on the IHttpClientBuilder
that’s returned when creating the client, as shown in the following code:
//Set 5 min as the lifetime for the HttpMessageHandler objects in the pool used for the
Catalog Typed Client
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<ICatalogService, CatalogService>()
.SetHandlerLifetime(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
Each Typed Client can have its own configured handler lifetime value. Set the lifetime to
InfiniteTimeSpan to disable handler expiry.
302 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

Implement your Typed Client classes that use the injected and configured
HttpClient
As a previous step, you need to have your Typed Client classes defined, such as the classes in the
sample code, like ‘BasketService’, ‘CatalogService’, ‘OrderingService’, etc. – A Typed Client is a class
that accepts an HttpClient object (injected through its constructor) and uses it to call some remote
HTTP service. For example:
public class CatalogService : ICatalogService
{
private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
private readonly string _remoteServiceBaseUrl;
public CatalogService(HttpClient httpClient)
{
_httpClient = httpClient;
}
public async Task<Catalog> GetCatalogItems(int page, int take,
int? brand, int? type)
{
var uri = API.Catalog.GetAllCatalogItems(_remoteServiceBaseUrl,
page, take, brand, type);
var responseString = await _httpClient.GetStringAsync(uri);
var catalog = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Catalog>(responseString);
return catalog;
}
}
The Typed Client (CatalogService in the example) is activated by DI (Dependency Injection), which
means it can accept any registered service in its constructor, in addition to HttpClient.
A Typed Client is effectively a transient object, that means a new instance is created each time one is
needed. It receives a new HttpClient instance each time it’s constructed. However, the
HttpMessageHandler objects in the pool are the objects that are reused by multiple HttpClient
instances.
Use your Typed Client classes
Finally, once you have your typed classes implemented, you can have them registered and configured
with AddHttpClient(). After that you can use them wherever services are injected by DI, such as in
Razor page code or an MVC web app controller, shown in the below code from eShopOnContainers:
namespace Microsoft.eShopOnContainers.WebMVC.Controllers
{
public class CatalogController : Controller
{
private ICatalogService _catalogSvc;
public CatalogController(ICatalogService catalogSvc) =>
_catalogSvc = catalogSvc;
public async Task<IActionResult> Index(int? BrandFilterApplied,
int? TypesFilterApplied,
303 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

int? page,
[FromQuery]string errorMsg)
{
var itemsPage = 10;
var catalog = await _catalogSvc.GetCatalogItems(page ?? 0,
itemsPage,
BrandFilterApplied,
TypesFilterApplied);
//… Additional code
}
}
}
Up to this point, the above code snippet only shows the example of performing regular HTTP
requests. But the ‘magic’ comes in the following sections where it shows how all the HTTP requests
made by HttpClient can have resilient policies such as retries with exponential backoff, circuit
breakers, security features using auth tokens, or even any other custom feature. And all of these can
be done just by adding policies and delegating handlers to your registered Typed Clients.

Implement HTTP call retries with exponential backoff
with IHttpClientFactory and Polly policies
The recommended approach for retries with exponential backoff is to take advantage of more
advanced .NET libraries like the open-source Polly library.
Polly is a .NET library that provides resilience and transient-fault handling capabilities. You can
implement those capabilities by applying Polly policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Bulkhead
Isolation, Timeout, and Fallback. Polly targets .NET Framework 4.x and .NET Standard 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0
(which supports .NET Core and later).
304 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

The following steps show how you can use Http retries with Polly integrated into IHttpClientFactory,
which is explained in the previous section.
Install .NET packages
First, you will need to install the Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly package.
• Install with Visual Studio
• Install with dotnet CLI
• Install with nuget.exe CLI
• Install with Package Manager Console (PowerShell)
Reference the .NET 7 packages
IHttpClientFactory is available since .NET Core 2.1, however, we recommend you use the latest .NET 7
packages from NuGet in your project. You typically also need to reference the extension package
Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly.
Configure a client with Polly’s Retry policy, in app startup
The AddPolicyHandler() method is what adds policies to the HttpClient objects you’ll use. In this
case, it’s adding a Polly’s policy for Http Retries with exponential backoff.
To have a more modular approach, the Http Retry Policy can be defined in a separate method within
the Program.cs file, as shown in the following code:
static IAsyncPolicy<HttpResponseMessage> GetRetryPolicy()
{
return HttpPolicyExtensions
.HandleTransientHttpError()
.OrResult(msg => msg.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.NotFound)
.WaitAndRetryAsync(6, retryAttempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2,
retryAttempt)));
}
As shown in previous sections, you need to define a named or typed client HttpClient configuration in
your standard Program.cs app configuration. Now you add incremental code specifying the policy for
the Http retries with exponential backoff, as follows:
// Program.cs
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<IBasketService, BasketService>()
.SetHandlerLifetime(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)) //Set lifetime to five minutes
.AddPolicyHandler(GetRetryPolicy());
With Polly, you can define a Retry policy with the number of retries, the exponential backoff
configuration, and the actions to take when there’s an HTTP exception, such as logging the error. In
this case, the policy is configured to try six times with an exponential retry, starting at two seconds.
Add a jitter strategy to the retry policy
A regular Retry policy can affect your system in cases of high concurrency and scalability and under
high contention. To overcome peaks of similar retries coming from many clients in partial outages, a
good workaround is to add a jitter strategy to the retry algorithm/policy. This strategy can improve
the overall performance of the end-to-end system. As recommended in Polly: Retry with Jitter, a good
305 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications


---

jitter strategy can be implemented by smooth and evenly distributed retry intervals applied with a
well-controlled median initial retry delay on an exponential backoff. This approach helps to spread out
the spikes when the issue arises. The principle is illustrated by the following example:
var delay = Backoff.DecorrelatedJitterBackoffV2(medianFirstRetryDelay:
TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), retryCount: 5);
var retryPolicy = Policy
.Handle<FooException>()
.WaitAndRetryAsync(delay);

Implement the Circuit Breaker pattern
As noted earlier, you should handle faults that might take a variable amount of time to recover from,
as might happen when you try to connect to a remote service or resource. Handling this type of fault
can improve the stability and resiliency of an application.
In a distributed environment, calls to remote resources and services can fail due to transient faults,
such as slow network connections and timeouts, or if resources are responding slowly or are
temporarily unavailable. These faults typically correct themselves after a short time, and a robust cloud
application should be prepared to handle them by using a strategy like the “Retry pattern”.
However, there can also be situations where faults are due to unanticipated events that might take
much longer to fix. These faults can range in severity from a partial loss of connectivity to the
complete failure of a service. In these situations, it might be pointless for an application to continually
retry an operation that’s unlikely to succeed.
Instead, the application should be coded to accept that the operation has failed and handle the failure
accordingly.
Using Http retries carelessly could result in creating a Denial of Service (DoS) attack within your own
software. As a microservice fails or performs slowly, multiple clients might repeatedly retry failed
requests. That creates a dangerous risk of exponentially increasing traffic targeted at the failing
service.
306 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

Therefore, you need some kind of defense barrier so that excessive requests stop when it isn’t worth
to keep trying. That defense barrier is precisely the circuit breaker.
The Circuit Breaker pattern has a different purpose than the “Retry pattern”. The “Retry pattern”
enables an application to retry an operation in the expectation that the operation will eventually
succeed. The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents an application from performing an operation that’s
likely to fail. An application can combine these two patterns. However, the retry logic should be
sensitive to any exception returned by the circuit breaker, and it should abandon retry attempts if the
circuit breaker indicates that a fault is not transient.
Implement Circuit Breaker pattern with IHttpClientFactory and Polly
As when implementing retries, the recommended approach for circuit breakers is to take advantage of
proven .NET libraries like Polly and its native integration with IHttpClientFactory.
Adding a circuit breaker policy into your IHttpClientFactory outgoing middleware pipeline is as simple
as adding a single incremental piece of code to what you already have when using IHttpClientFactory.
The only addition here to the code used for HTTP call retries is the code where you add the Circuit
Breaker policy to the list of policies to use, as shown in the following incremental code.
// Program.cs
var retryPolicy = GetRetryPolicy();
var circuitBreakerPolicy = GetCircuitBreakerPolicy();
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<IBasketService, BasketService>()
.SetHandlerLifetime(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)) // Sample: default lifetime is 2
minutes
.AddHttpMessageHandler<HttpClientAuthorizationDelegatingHandler>()
.AddPolicyHandler(retryPolicy)
.AddPolicyHandler(circuitBreakerPolicy);
The AddPolicyHandler() method is what adds policies to the HttpClient objects you’ll use. In this case,
it’s adding a Polly policy for a circuit breaker.
To have a more modular approach, the Circuit Breaker Policy is defined in a separate method called
GetCircuitBreakerPolicy(), as shown in the following code:
// also in Program.cs
static IAsyncPolicy<HttpResponseMessage> GetCircuitBreakerPolicy()
{
return HttpPolicyExtensions
.HandleTransientHttpError()
.CircuitBreakerAsync(5, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));
}
In the code example above, the circuit breaker policy is configured so it breaks or opens the circuit
when there have been five consecutive faults when retrying the Http requests. When that happens,
the circuit will break for 30 seconds: in that period, calls will be failed immediately by the circuit-
breaker rather than actually be placed. The policy automatically interprets relevant exceptions and
HTTP status codes as faults.
Circuit breakers should also be used to redirect requests to a fallback infrastructure if you had issues
in a particular resource that’s deployed in a different environment than the client application or
307 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

service that’s performing the HTTP call. That way, if there’s an outage in the datacenter that impacts
only your backend microservices but not your client applications, the client applications can redirect
to the fallback services. Polly is planning a new policy to automate this failover policy scenario.
All those features are for cases where you’re managing the failover from within the .NET code, as
opposed to having it managed automatically for you by Azure, with location transparency.
From a usage point of view, when using HttpClient, there’s no need to add anything new here
because the code is the same than when using HttpClient with IHttpClientFactory, as shown in
previous sections.
Test Http retries and circuit breakers in eShopOnContainers
Whenever you start the eShopOnContainers solution in a Docker host, it needs to start multiple
containers. Some of the containers are slower to start and initialize, like the SQL Server container. This
is especially true the first time you deploy the eShopOnContainers application into Docker because it
needs to set up the images and the database. The fact that some containers start slower than others
can cause the rest of the services to initially throw HTTP exceptions, even if you set dependencies
between containers at the docker-compose level, as explained in previous sections. Those docker-
compose dependencies between containers are just at the process level. The container’s entry point
process might be started, but SQL Server might not be ready for queries. The result can be a cascade
of errors, and the application can get an exception when trying to consume that particular container.
You might also see this type of error on startup when the application is deploying to the cloud. In that
case, orchestrators might be moving containers from one node or VM to another (that is, starting new
instances) when balancing the number of containers across the cluster’s nodes.
The way ‘eShopOnContainers’ solves those issues when starting all the containers is by using the Retry
pattern illustrated earlier.
Test the circuit breaker in eShopOnContainers
There are a few ways you can break/open the circuit and test it with eShopOnContainers.
One option is to lower the allowed number of retries to 1 in the circuit breaker policy and redeploy
the whole solution into Docker. With a single retry, there’s a good chance that an HTTP request will
fail during deployment, the circuit breaker will open, and you get an error.
Another option is to use custom middleware that’s implemented in the Basket microservice. When
this middleware is enabled, it catches all HTTP requests and returns status code 500. You can enable
the middleware by making a GET request to the failing URI, like the following:
• GET http://localhost:5103/failing
This request returns the current state of the middleware. If the middleware is enabled, the
request return status code 500. If the middleware is disabled, there’s no response.
• GET http://localhost:5103/failing?enable
This request enables the middleware.
308 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

• GET http://localhost:5103/failing?disable
This request disables the middleware.
For instance, once the application is running, you can enable the middleware by making a request
using the following URI in any browser. Note that the ordering microservice uses port 5103.
http://localhost:5103/failing?enable
You can then check the status using the URI http://localhost:5103/failing, as shown in Figure 8-5.
Figure 8-5. Checking the state of the “Failing” ASP.NET middleware – In this case, disabled.
At this point, the Basket microservice responds with status code 500 whenever you call invoke it.
Once the middleware is running, you can try making an order from the MVC web application. Because
the requests fail, the circuit will open.
In the following example, you can see that the MVC web application has a catch block in the logic for
placing an order. If the code catches an open-circuit exception, it shows the user a friendly message
telling them to wait.
public class CartController : Controller
{
//…
public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
{
try
{
var user = _appUserParser.Parse(HttpContext.User);
//Http requests using the Typed Client (Service Agent)
var vm = await _basketSvc.GetBasket(user);
return View(vm);
}
catch (BrokenCircuitException)
{
// Catches error when Basket.api is in circuit-opened mode
HandleBrokenCircuitException();
}
return View();
}
private void HandleBrokenCircuitException()
{
TempData["BasketInoperativeMsg"] = "Basket Service is inoperative, please try later
on. (Business message due to Circuit-Breaker)";
}
}
Here’s a summary. The Retry policy tries several times to make the HTTP request and gets HTTP errors.
When the number of retries reaches the maximum number set for the Circuit Breaker policy (in this
case, 5), the application throws a BrokenCircuitException. The result is a friendly message, as shown in
Figure 8-6.
309 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications


Figure 8-6. Circuit breaker returning an error to the UI
You can implement different logic for when to open/break the circuit. Or you can try an HTTP request
against a different back-end microservice if there’s a fallback datacenter or redundant back-end
system.
Finally, another possibility for the CircuitBreakerPolicy is to use Isolate (which forces open and holds
open the circuit) and Reset (which closes it again). These could be used to build a utility HTTP
endpoint that invokes Isolate and Reset directly on the policy. Such an HTTP endpoint could also be
used, suitably secured, in production for temporarily isolating a downstream system, such as when
you want to upgrade it. Or it could trip the circuit manually to protect a downstream system you
suspect to be faulting.

Health monitoring
Health monitoring can allow near-real-time information about the state of your containers and
microservices. Health monitoring is critical to multiple aspects of operating microservices and is
especially important when orchestrators perform partial application upgrades in phases, as explained
later.
Microservices-based applications often use heartbeats or health checks to enable their performance
monitors, schedulers, and orchestrators to keep track of the multitude of services. If services cannot
send some sort of “I’m alive” signal, either on demand or on a schedule, your application might face
risks when you deploy updates, or it might just detect failures too late and not be able to stop
cascading failures that can end up in major outages.
In the typical model, services send reports about their status, and that information is aggregated to
provide an overall view of the state of health of your application. If you’re using an orchestrator, you
can provide health information to your orchestrator’s cluster, so that the cluster can act accordingly. If
you invest in high-quality health reporting that’s customized for your application, you can detect and
fix issues for your running application much more easily.
310 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications


Implement health checks in ASP.NET Core services
When developing an ASP.NET Core microservice or web application, you can use the built-in health
checks feature that was released in ASP .NET Core 2.2
(Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks). Like many ASP.NET Core features, health checks
come with a set of services and a middleware.
Health check services and middleware are easy to use and provide capabilities that let you validate if
any external resource needed for your application (like a SQL Server database or a remote API) is
working properly. When you use this feature, you can also decide what it means that the resource is
healthy, as we explain later.
To use this feature effectively, you need to first configure services in your microservices. Second, you
need a front-end application that queries for the health reports. That front-end application could be a
custom reporting application, or it could be an orchestrator itself that can react accordingly to the
health states.
Use the HealthChecks feature in your back-end ASP.NET microservices
In this section, you’ll learn how to implement the HealthChecks feature in a sample ASP.NET Core 7.0
Web API application when using the Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks package. The
Implementation of this feature in a large-scale microservices like the eShopOnContainers is explained
in the next section.
To begin, you need to define what constitutes a healthy status for each microservice. In the sample
application, we define the microservice is healthy if its API is accessible via HTTP and its related SQL
Server database is also available.
In .NET 7, with the built-in APIs, you can configure the services, add a Health Check for the
microservice and its dependent SQL Server database in this way:
// Program.cs from .NET 7 Web API sample
//...
// Registers required services for health checks
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
// Add a health check for a SQL Server database
.AddCheck(
"OrderingDB-check",
new SqlConnectionHealthCheck(builder.Configuration["ConnectionString"]),
HealthStatus.Unhealthy,
new string[] { "orderingdb" });
In the previous code, the services.AddHealthChecks() method configures a basic HTTP check that
returns a status code 200 with “Healthy”. Further, the AddCheck() extension method configures a
custom SqlConnectionHealthCheck that checks the related SQL Database’s health.
The AddCheck() method adds a new health check with a specified name and the implementation of
type IHealthCheck. You can add multiple Health Checks using AddCheck method, so a microservice
won’t provide a “healthy” status until all its checks are healthy.
311 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

SqlConnectionHealthCheck is a custom class that implements IHealthCheck, which takes a connection
string as a constructor parameter and executes a simple query to check if the connection to the SQL
database is successful. It returns HealthCheckResult.Healthy() if the query was executed successfully
and a FailureStatus with the actual exception when it fails.
// Sample SQL Connection Health Check
public class SqlConnectionHealthCheck : IHealthCheck
{
private const string DefaultTestQuery = "Select 1";
public string ConnectionString { get; }
public string TestQuery { get; }
public SqlConnectionHealthCheck(string connectionString)
: this(connectionString, testQuery: DefaultTestQuery)
{
}
public SqlConnectionHealthCheck(string connectionString, string testQuery)
{
ConnectionString = connectionString ?? throw new
ArgumentNullException(nameof(connectionString));
TestQuery = testQuery;
}
public async Task<HealthCheckResult> CheckHealthAsync(HealthCheckContext context,
CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken))
{
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
try
{
await connection.OpenAsync(cancellationToken);
if (TestQuery != null)
{
var command = connection.CreateCommand();
command.CommandText = TestQuery;
await command.ExecuteNonQueryAsync(cancellationToken);
}
}
catch (DbException ex)
{
return new HealthCheckResult(status: context.Registration.FailureStatus,
exception: ex);
}
}
return HealthCheckResult.Healthy();
}
}
Note that in the previous code, Select 1 is the query used to check the Health of the database. To
monitor the availability of your microservices, orchestrators like Kubernetes periodically perform
health checks by sending requests to test the microservices. It’s important to keep your database
queries efficient so that these operations are quick and don’t result in a higher utilization of resources.
312 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

Finally, add a middleware that responds to the url path /hc:
// Program.cs from .NET 7 Web Api sample
app.MapHealthChecks("/hc");
When the endpoint <yourmicroservice>/hc is invoked, it runs all the health checks that are configured
in the AddHealthChecks() method in the Startup class and shows the result.
HealthChecks implementation in eShopOnContainers
Microservices in eShopOnContainers rely on multiple services to perform its task. For example, the
Catalog.API microservice from eShopOnContainers depends on many services, such as Azure Blob
Storage, SQL Server, and RabbitMQ. Therefore, it has several health checks added using the
AddCheck() method. For every dependent service, a custom IHealthCheck implementation that
defines its respective health status would need to be added.
The open-source project AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks solves this problem by providing
custom health check implementations for each of these enterprise services, that are built on top of
.NET 7. Each health check is available as an individual NuGet package that can be easily added to the
project. eShopOnContainers uses them extensively in all its microservices.
For instance, in the Catalog.API microservice, the following NuGet packages were added:
Figure 8-7. Custom Health Checks implemented in Catalog.API using AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks
In the following code, the health check implementations are added for each dependent service and
then the middleware is configured:
// Extension method from Catalog.api microservice
//
public static IServiceCollection AddCustomHealthCheck(this IServiceCollection services,
IConfiguration configuration)
{
var accountName = configuration.GetValue<string>("AzureStorageAccountName");
var accountKey = configuration.GetValue<string>("AzureStorageAccountKey");
var hcBuilder = services.AddHealthChecks();
313 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications


hcBuilder
.AddSqlServer(
configuration["ConnectionString"],
name: "CatalogDB-check",
tags: new string[] { "catalogdb" });
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(accountName) && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(accountKey))
{
hcBuilder
.AddAzureBlobStorage(
$"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName={accountName};AccountKey={accountKey};Endpoint
Suffix=core.windows.net",
name: "catalog-storage-check",
tags: new string[] { "catalogstorage" });
}
if (configuration.GetValue<bool>("AzureServiceBusEnabled"))
{
hcBuilder
.AddAzureServiceBusTopic(
configuration["EventBusConnection"],
topicName: "eshop_event_bus",
name: "catalog-servicebus-check",
tags: new string[] { "servicebus" });
}
else
{
hcBuilder
.AddRabbitMQ(
$"amqp://{configuration["EventBusConnection"]}",
name: "catalog-rabbitmqbus-check",
tags: new string[] { "rabbitmqbus" });
}
return services;
}
Finally, add the HealthCheck middleware to listen to “/hc” endpoint:
// HealthCheck middleware
app.UseHealthChecks("/hc", new HealthCheckOptions()
{
Predicate = _ => true,
ResponseWriter = UIResponseWriter.WriteHealthCheckUIResponse
});
Query your microservices to report about their health status
When you’ve configured health checks as described in this article and you have the microservice
running in Docker, you can directly check from a browser if it’s healthy. You have to publish the
container port in the Docker host, so you can access the container through the external Docker host IP
or through host.docker.internal, as shown in figure 8-8.
314 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications

Figure 8-8. Checking health status of a single service from a browser
In that test, you can see that the Catalog.API microservice (running on port 5101) is healthy, returning
HTTP status 200 and status information in JSON. The service also checked the health of its SQL Server
database dependency and RabbitMQ, so the health check reported itself as healthy.
Use watchdogs
A watchdog is a separate service that can watch health and load across services, and report health
about the microservices by querying with the HealthChecks library introduced earlier. This can help
prevent errors that would not be detected based on the view of a single service. Watchdogs also are a
good place to host code that can perform remediation actions for known conditions without user
interaction.
The eShopOnContainers sample contains a web page that displays sample health check reports, as
shown in Figure 8-9. This is the simplest watchdog you could have since it only shows the state of the
microservices and web applications in eShopOnContainers. Usually a watchdog also takes actions
when it detects unhealthy states.
Fortunately, AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks also provides AspNetCore.HealthChecks.UI NuGet
package that can be used to display the health check results from the configured URIs.
315 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications



---

Figure 8-9. Sample health check report in eShopOnContainers
In summary, this watchdog service queries each microservice’s “/hc” endpoint. This will execute all the
health checks defined within it and return an overall health state depending on all those checks. The
HealthChecksUI is easy to consume with a few configuration entries and two lines of code that needs
to be added into the Startup.cs of the watchdog service.
Sample configuration file for health check UI:
// Configuration
{
"HealthChecksUI": {
"HealthChecks": [
{
"Name": "Ordering HTTP Check",
"Uri": "http://host.docker.internal:5102/hc"
},
{
"Name": "Ordering HTTP Background Check",
"Uri": "http://host.docker.internal:5111/hc"
},
//...
]}
}
Program.cs file that adds HealthChecksUI:
316 CHAPTER 7 | Implement resilient applications


// Program.cs from WebStatus(Watch Dog) service
//
// Registers required services for health checks
builder.Services.AddHealthChecksUI();
// build the app, register other middleware
app.UseHealthChecksUI(config => config.UIPath = "/hc-ui");
Health checks when using orchestrators
To monitor the availability of your microservices, orchestrators like Kubernetes and Service Fabric
periodically perform health checks by sending requests to test the microservices. When an
orchestrator determines that a service/container is unhealthy, it stops routing requests to that
instance. It also usually creates a new instance of that container.
For instance, most orchestrators can use health checks to manage zero-downtime deployments. Only
when the status of a service/container changes to healthy will the orchestrator start routing traffic to
service/container instances.
Health monitoring is especially important when an orchestrator performs an application upgrade.
Some orchestrators (like Azure Service Fabric) update services in phases—for example, they might
update one-fifth of the cluster surface for each application upgrade. The set of nodes that’s upgraded
at the same time is referred to as an upgrade domain. After each upgrade domain has been upgraded
and is available to users, that upgrade domain must pass health checks before the deployment moves
to the next upgrade domain.
Another aspect of service health is reporting metrics from the service. This is an advanced capability of
the health model of some orchestrators, like Service Fabric. Metrics are important when using an
orchestrator because they are used to balance resource usage. Metrics also can be an indicator of
system health. For example, you might have an application that has many microservices, and each
instance reports a requests-per-second (RPS) metric. If one service is using more resources (memory,
processor, etc.) than another service, the orchestrator could move service instances around in the
cluster to try to maintain even resource utilization.
Note that Azure Service Fabric provides its own Health Monitoring model, which is more advanced
than simple health checks.
Advanced monitoring: visualization, analysis, and alerts
The final part of monitoring is visualizing the event stream, reporting on service performance, and
alerting when an issue is detected. You can use different solutions for this aspect of monitoring.
You can use simple custom applications showing the state of your services, like the custom page
shown when explaining the AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks. Or you could use more advanced
tools like Azure Monitor to raise alerts based on the stream of events.
Finally, if you’re storing all the event streams, you can use Microsoft Power BI or other solutions like
Kibana or Splunk to visualize the data.

CHAPTER
Make secure .NET
Microservices and Web
Applications
There are so many aspects about security in microservices and web applications that the topic could
easily take several books like this one. So, in this section, we’ll focus on authentication, authorization,
and application secrets.
Implement authentication in .NET microservices and
web applications
It’s often necessary for resources and APIs published by a service to be limited to certain trusted users
or clients. The first step to making these sorts of API-level trust decisions is authentication.
Authentication is the process of reliably verifying a user’s identity.
In microservice scenarios, authentication is typically handled centrally. If you’re using an API Gateway,
the gateway is a good place to authenticate, as shown in Figure 9-1. If you use this approach, make
sure that the individual microservices cannot be reached directly (without the API Gateway) unless
additional security is in place to authenticate messages whether they come from the gateway or not.
Figure 9-1. Centralized authentication with an API Gateway
When the API Gateway centralizes authentication, it adds user information when forwarding requests
to the microservices. If services can be accessed directly, an authentication service like Azure Active
319 CHAPTER 8 | Make secure .NET Microservices and Web Applications


Directory or a dedicated authentication microservice acting as a security token service (STS) can be
used to authenticate users. Trust decisions are shared between services with security tokens or
cookies. (These tokens can be shared between ASP.NET Core applications, if needed, by implementing
cookie sharing.) This pattern is illustrated in Figure 9-2.
Figure 9-2. Authentication by identity microservice; trust is shared using an authorization token
When microservices are accessed directly, trust, that includes authentication and authorization, is
handled by a security token issued by a dedicated microservice, shared between microservices.
Authenticate with ASP.NET Core Identity
The primary mechanism in ASP.NET Core for identifying an application’s users is the ASP.NET Core
Identity membership system. ASP.NET Core Identity stores user information (including sign-in
information, roles, and claims) in a data store configured by the developer. Typically, the ASP.NET
Core Identity data store is an Entity Framework store provided in the
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore package. However, custom stores or other third-
party packages can be used to store identity information in Azure Table Storage, CosmosDB, or other
locations.
Tip
ASP.NET Core 2.1 and later provides ASP.NET Core Identity as a Razor Class Library, so you won’t see
much of the necessary code in your project, as was the case for previous versions. For details on how
to customize the Identity code to suit your needs, see Scaffold Identity in ASP.NET Core projects.
The following code is taken from the ASP.NET Core Web Application MVC 3.1 project template with
individual user account authentication selected. It shows how to configure ASP.NET Core Identity
using Entity Framework Core in the Program.cs file.
//...
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
options.UseSqlServer(
builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
320 CHAPTER 8 | Make secure .NET Microservices and Web Applications


builder.Services.AddDefaultIdentity<IdentityUser>(options =>
options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
.AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
//...
Once ASP.NET Core Identity is configured, you enable it by adding the
app.UseAuthentication() and endpoints.MapRazorPages() as shown in the following code in the
service’s Program.cs file:
//...
app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
endpoints.MapRazorPages();
});
//...
Important
The lines in the preceding code MUST BE IN THE ORDER SHOWN for Identity to work correctly.
Using ASP.NET Core Identity enables several scenarios:
• Create new user information using the UserManager type (userManager.CreateAsync).
• Authenticate users using the SignInManager type. You can use signInManager.SignInAsync to
sign in directly, or signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync to confirm the user’s password is
correct and then sign them in.
• Identify a user based on information stored in a cookie (which is read by ASP.NET Core
Identity middleware) so that subsequent requests from a browser will include a signed-in
user’s identity and claims.
ASP.NET Core Identity also supports two-factor authentication.
For authentication scenarios that make use of a local user data store and that persist identity between
requests using cookies (as is typical for MVC web applications), ASP.NET Core Identity is a
recommended solution.
Authenticate with external providers
ASP.NET Core also supports using external authentication providers to let users sign in via OAuth 2.0
flows. This means that users can sign in using existing authentication processes from providers like
Microsoft, Google, Facebook, or Twitter and associate those identities with an ASP.NET Core identity
in your application.
To use external authentication, besides including the authentication middleware as mentioned before,
using the app.UseAuthentication() method, you also have to register the external provider in
Program.cs as shown in the following example:
321 CHAPTER 8 | Make secure .NET Microservices and Web Applications

//...
services.AddDefaultIdentity<IdentityUser>(options => options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount
= true)
.AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();
services.AddAuthentication()
.AddMicrosoftAccount(microsoftOptions =>
{
microsoftOptions.ClientId =
builder.Configuration["Authentication:Microsoft:ClientId"];
microsoftOptions.ClientSecret =
builder.Configuration["Authentication:Microsoft:ClientSecret"];
})
.AddGoogle(googleOptions => { ... })
.AddTwitter(twitterOptions => { ... })
.AddFacebook(facebookOptions => { ... });
//...
Popular external authentication providers and their associated NuGet packages are shown in the
following table:
Provider Package
Microsoft Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.MicrosoftAccount
Google Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google
Facebook Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Facebook
Twitter Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter
In all cases, you must complete an application registration procedure that is vendor dependent and
that usually involves:
1. Getting a Client Application ID.
2. Getting a Client Application Secret.
3. Configuring a redirection URL, that’s handled by the authorization middleware and the
registered provider
4. Optionally, configuring a sign-out URL to properly handle sign out in a Single Sign On (SSO)
scenario.
For details on configuring your app for an external provider, see the External provider authentication
in the ASP.NET Core documentation).
Tip
All details are handled by the authorization middleware and services previously mentioned. So, you
just have to choose the Individual User Account authentication option when you create the ASP.NET
Core web application project in Visual Studio, as shown in Figure 9-3, besides registering the
authentication providers previously mentioned.
322 CHAPTER 8 | Make secure .NET Microservices and Web Applications

Figure 9-3. Selecting the Individual User Accounts option, for using external authentication, when creating a web
application project in Visual Studio 2019.
In addition to the external authentication providers listed previously, third-party packages are
available that provide middleware for using many more external authentication providers. For a list,
see the AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers repository on GitHub.
You can also create your own external authentication middleware to solve some special need.
Authenticate with bearer tokens
Authenticating with ASP.NET Core Identity (or Identity plus external authentication providers) works
well for many web application scenarios in which storing user information in a cookie is appropriate.
In other scenarios, though, cookies are not a natural means of persisting and transmitting data.
For example, in an ASP.NET Core Web API that exposes RESTful endpoints that might be accessed by
Single Page Applications (SPAs), by native clients, or even by other Web APIs, you typically want to
use bearer token authentication instead. These types of applications do not work with cookies, but
can easily retrieve a bearer token and include it in the authorization header of subsequent requests.
To enable token authentication, ASP.NET Core supports several options for using OAuth 2.0 and
OpenID Connect.
323 CHAPTER 8 | Make secure .NET Microservices and Web Applications


Authenticate with an OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0 Identity provider
If user information is stored in Azure Active Directory or another identity solution that supports
OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0, you can use the
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect package to authenticate using the OpenID
Connect workflow. For example, to authenticate to the Identity.Api microservice in
eShopOnContainers, an ASP.NET Core web application can use middleware from that package as
shown in the following simplified example in Program.cs:
// Program.cs
var identityUrl = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("IdentityUrl");
var callBackUrl = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("CallBackUrl");
var sessionCookieLifetime = builder.Configuration.GetValue("SessionCookieLifetimeMinutes",
60);
// Add Authentication services
services.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie(setup => setup.ExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(sessionCookieLifetime))
.AddOpenIdConnect(options =>
{
options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
options.Authority = identityUrl.ToString();
options.SignedOutRedirectUri = callBackUrl.ToString();
options.ClientId = useLoadTest ? "mvctest" : "mvc";
options.ClientSecret = "secret";
options.ResponseType = useLoadTest ? "code id_token token" : "code id_token";
options.SaveTokens = true;
options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
options.Scope.Add("openid");
options.Scope.Add("profile");
options.Scope.Add("orders");
options.Scope.Add("basket");
options.Scope.Add("marketing");
options.Scope.Add("locations");
options.Scope.Add("webshoppingagg");
options.Scope.Add("orders.signalrhub");
});
// Build the app
//…
app.UseAuthentication();
//…
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
//...
});
When you use this workflow, the ASP.NET Core Identity middleware is not needed, because all user
information storage and authentication is handled by the Identity service.
324 CHAPTER 8 | Make secure .NET Microservices and Web Applications

Issue security tokens from an ASP.NET Core service
If you prefer to issue security tokens for local ASP.NET Core Identity users rather than using an
external identity provider, you can take advantage of some good third-party libraries.
IdentityServer4 and OpenIddict are OpenID Connect providers that integrate easily with ASP.NET Core
Identity to let you issue security tokens from an ASP.NET Core service. The IdentityServer4
documentation has in-depth instructions for using the library. However, the basic steps to using
IdentityServer4 to issue tokens are as follows.
1. You configure IdentityServer4 in Program.cs by making a call to
builder.Services.AddIdentityServer.
2. You call app.UseIdentityServer in Program.cs to add IdentityServer4 to the application’s HTTP
request processing pipeline. This lets the library serve requests to OpenID Connect and
OAuth2 endpoints like /connect/token.
3. You configure identity server by setting the following data:
– The credentials to use for signing.
– The Identity and API resources that users might request access to:
• API resources represent protected data or functionality that a user can access
with an access token. An example of an API resource would be a web API (or
set of APIs) that requires authorization.
• Identity resources represent information (claims) that are given to a client to
identify a user. The claims might include the user name, email address, and so
on.
– The clients that will be connecting in order to request tokens.
– The storage mechanism for user information, such as ASP.NET Core Identity or an
alternative.
When you specify clients and resources for IdentityServer4 to use, you can pass an IEnumerable
collection of the appropriate type to methods that take in-memory client or resource stores. Or for
more complex scenarios, you can provide client or resource provider types via Dependency Injection.
A sample configuration for IdentityServer4 to use in-memory resources and clients provided by a
custom IClientStore type might look like the following example:
// Program.cs
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IClientStore, CustomClientStore>();
builder.Services.AddIdentityServer()
.AddSigningCredential("CN=sts")
.AddInMemoryApiResources(MyApiResourceProvider.GetAllResources())
.AddAspNetIdentity<ApplicationUser>();
//...

Consume security tokens
Authenticating against an OpenID Connect endpoint or issuing your own security tokens covers some
scenarios. But what about a service that simply needs to limit access to those users who have valid
security tokens that were provided by a different service?
For that scenario, authentication middleware that handles JWT tokens is available in the
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer package. JWT stands for “JSON Web Token” and
is a common security token format (defined by RFC 7519) for communicating security claims. A
simplified example of how to use middleware to consume such tokens might look like this code
fragment, taken from the Ordering.Api microservice of eShopOnContainers.
// Program.cs
var identityUrl = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("IdentityUrl");
// Add Authentication services
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme =
AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
options.DefaultChallengeScheme =
AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
}).AddJwtBearer(options =>
{
options.Authority = identityUrl;
options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
options.Audience = "orders";
});
// Build the app
app.UseAuthentication();
//…
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
//...
});
The parameters in this usage are:
• Audience represents the receiver of the incoming token or the resource that the token grants
access to. If the value specified in this parameter does not match the parameter in the token,
the token will be rejected.
• Authority is the address of the token-issuing authentication server. The JWT bearer
authentication middleware uses this URI to get the public key that can be used to validate the
token’s signature. The middleware also confirms that the iss parameter in the token matches
this URI.
Another parameter, RequireHttpsMetadata, is useful for testing purposes; you set this parameter to
false so you can test in environments where you don’t have certificates. In real-world deployments,
JWT bearer tokens should always be passed only over HTTPS.
326 CHAPTER 8 | Make secure .NET Microservices and Web Applications

With this middleware in place, JWT tokens are automatically extracted from authorization headers.
They are then deserialized, validated (using the values in the Audience and Authority parameters), and
stored as user information to be referenced later by MVC actions or authorization filters.
The JWT bearer authentication middleware can also support more advanced scenarios, such as using a
local certificate to validate a token if the authority is not available. For this scenario, you can specify a
TokenValidationParameters object in the JwtBearerOptions object.

About authorization in .NET microservices and web
applications
After authentication, ASP.NET Core Web APIs need to authorize access. This process allows a service
to make APIs available to some authenticated users, but not to all. Authorization can be done based
on users’ roles or based on custom policy, which might include inspecting claims or other heuristics.
Restricting access to an ASP.NET Core MVC route is as easy as applying an Authorize attribute to the
action method (or to the controller’s class if all the controller’s actions require authorization), as
shown in following example:
public class AccountController : Controller
{
public ActionResult Login()
{
}
[Authorize]
327 CHAPTER 8 | Make secure .NET Microservices and Web Applications

public ActionResult Logout()
{
}
}
By default, adding an Authorize attribute without parameters will limit access to authenticated users
for that controller or action. To further restrict an API to be available for only specific users, the
attribute can be expanded to specify required roles or policies that users must satisfy.
Implement role-based authorization
ASP.NET Core Identity has a built-in concept of roles. In addition to users, ASP.NET Core Identity
stores information about different roles used by the application and keeps track of which users are
assigned to which roles. These assignments can be changed programmatically with the RoleManager
type that updates roles in persisted storage, and the UserManager type that can grant or revoke roles
from users.
If you’re authenticating with JWT bearer tokens, the ASP.NET Core JWT bearer authentication
middleware will populate a user’s roles based on role claims found in the token. To limit access to an
MVC action or controller to users in specific roles, you can include a Roles parameter in the Authorize
annotation (attribute), as shown in the following code fragment:
[Authorize(Roles = "Administrator, PowerUser")]
public class ControlPanelController : Controller
{
public ActionResult SetTime()
{
}
[Authorize(Roles = "Administrator")]
public ActionResult ShutDown()
{
}
}
In this example, only users in the Administrator or PowerUser roles can access APIs in the
ControlPanel controller (such as executing the SetTime action). The ShutDown API is further restricted
to allow access only to users in the Administrator role.
To require a user be in multiple roles, you use multiple Authorize attributes, as shown in the following
example:
[Authorize(Roles = "Administrator, PowerUser")]
[Authorize(Roles = "RemoteEmployee ")]
[Authorize(Policy = "CustomPolicy")]
public ActionResult API1 ()
{
}
In this example, to call API1, a user must:
• Be in the Administrator or PowerUser role, and
• Be in the RemoteEmployee role, and
328 CHAPTER 8 | Make secure .NET Microservices and Web Applications

• Satisfy a custom handler for CustomPolicy authorization.
Implement policy-based authorization
Custom authorization rules can also be written using authorization policies. This section provides an
overview. For more information, see the ASP.NET Authorization Workshop.
Custom authorization policies are registered in the Startup.ConfigureServices method using the
service.AddAuthorization method. This method takes a delegate that configures an
AuthorizationOptions argument.
services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
options.AddPolicy("AdministratorsOnly", policy =>
policy.RequireRole("Administrator"));
options.AddPolicy("EmployeesOnly", policy =>
policy.RequireClaim("EmployeeNumber"));
options.AddPolicy("Over21", policy =>
policy.Requirements.Add(new MinimumAgeRequirement(21)));
});
As shown in the example, policies can be associated with different types of requirements. After the
policies are registered, they can be applied to an action or controller by passing the policy’s name as
the Policy argument of the Authorize attribute (for example, [Authorize(Policy="EmployeesOnly")])
Policies can have multiple requirements, not just one (as shown in these examples).
In the previous example, the first AddPolicy call is just an alternative way of authorizing by role. If
[Authorize(Policy="AdministratorsOnly")] is applied to an API, only users in the Administrator role will
be able to access it.
The second AddPolicy call demonstrates an easy way to require that a particular claim should be
present for the user. The RequireClaim method also optionally takes expected values for the claim. If
values are specified, the requirement is met only if the user has both a claim of the correct type and
one of the specified values. If you’re using the JWT bearer authentication middleware, all JWT
properties will be available as user claims.
The most interesting policy shown here is in the third AddPolicy method, because it uses a custom
authorization requirement. By using custom authorization requirements, you can have a great deal of
control over how authorization is performed. For this to work, you must implement these types:
• A Requirements type that derives from IAuthorizationRequirement and that contains fields
specifying the details of the requirement. In the example, this is an age field for the sample
MinimumAgeRequirement type.
• A handler that implements AuthorizationHandler, where T is the type of
IAuthorizationRequirement that the handler can satisfy. The handler must implement the
HandleRequirementAsync method, which checks whether a specified context that contains
information about the user satisfies the requirement.
329 CHAPTER 8 | Make secure .NET Microservices and Web Applications

If the user meets the requirement, a call to context.Succeed will indicate that the user is authorized. If
there are multiple ways that a user might satisfy an authorization requirement, multiple handlers can
be created.
In addition to registering custom policy requirements with AddPolicy calls, you also need to register
custom requirement handlers via Dependency Injection (services.AddTransient<IAuthorizationHandler,
MinimumAgeHandler>()).
An example of a custom authorization requirement and handler for checking a user’s age (based on a
DateOfBirth claim) is available in the ASP.NET Core authorization documentation.
Authorization and minimal apis
ASP.NET supports minimal APIs as an alternative to controller-based APIs. Authorization policies are
the recommended way to configure authorization for minimal APIs, as this example demonstrates:
// Program.cs
builder.Services.AddAuthorizationBuilder()
.AddPolicy("admin_greetings", policy =>
policy
.RequireRole("admin")
.RequireScope("greetings_api"));
// build the app
app.MapGet("/hello", () => "Hello world!")
.RequireAuthorization("admin_greetings");

Store application secrets safely during development
To connect with protected resources and other services, ASP.NET Core applications typically need to
use connection strings, passwords, or other credentials that contain sensitive information. These
sensitive pieces of information are called secrets. It’s a best practice to not include secrets in source
330 CHAPTER 8 | Make secure .NET Microservices and Web Applications

code and making sure not to store secrets in source control. Instead, you should use the ASP.NET
Core configuration model to read the secrets from more secure locations.
You must separate the secrets for accessing development and staging resources from the ones used
for accessing production resources, because different individuals will need access to those different
sets of secrets. To store secrets used during development, common approaches are to either store
secrets in environment variables or by using the ASP.NET Core Secret Manager tool. For more secure
storage in production environments, microservices can store secrets in an Azure Key Vault.
Store secrets in environment variables
One way to keep secrets out of source code is for developers to set string-based secrets as
environment variables on their development machines. When you use environment variables to store
secrets with hierarchical names, such as the ones nested in configuration sections, you must name the
variables to include the complete hierarchy of its sections, delimited with colons (:).
For example, setting an environment variable Logging:LogLevel:Default to Debug value would be
equivalent to a configuration value from the following JSON file:
{
"Logging": {
"LogLevel": {
"Default": "Debug"
}
}
}
To access these values from environment variables, the application just needs to call
AddEnvironmentVariables on its ConfigurationBuilder when constructing an IConfigurationRoot
object.
Note
Environment variables are commonly stored as plain text, so if the machine or process with the
environment variables is compromised, the environment variable values will be visible.
Store secrets with the ASP.NET Core Secret Manager
The ASP.NET Core Secret Manager tool provides another method of keeping secrets out of source
code during development. To use the Secret Manager tool, install the package
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.SecretManager in your project file. Once that dependency is
present and has been restored, the dotnet user-secrets command can be used to set the value of
secrets from the command line. These secrets will be stored in a JSON file in the user’s profile
directory (details vary by OS), away from source code.
Secrets set by the Secret Manager tool are organized by the UserSecretsId property of the project
that’s using the secrets. Therefore, you must be sure to set the UserSecretsId property in your project
file, as shown in the snippet below. The default value is a GUID assigned by Visual Studio, but the
actual string is not important as long as it’s unique in your computer.
331 CHAPTER 8 | Make secure .NET Microservices and Web Applications

<PropertyGroup>
<UserSecretsId>UniqueIdentifyingString</UserSecretsId>
</PropertyGroup>
Using secrets stored with Secret Manager in an application is accomplished by calling
AddUserSecrets<T> on the ConfigurationBuilder instance to include secrets for the application in its
configuration. The generic parameter T should be a type from the assembly that the UserSecretId was
applied to. Usually, using AddUserSecrets<Startup> is fine.
The AddUserSecrets<Startup>() is included in the default options for the Development environment
when using the CreateDefaultBuilder method in Program.cs.
Use Azure Key Vault to protect secrets at production
time
Secrets stored as environment variables or stored by the Secret Manager tool are still stored locally
and unencrypted on the machine. A more secure option for storing secrets is Azure Key Vault, which
provides a secure, central location for storing keys and secrets.
The Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.Configuration.Secrets package allows an ASP.NET Core
application to read configuration information from Azure Key Vault. To start using secrets from an
Azure Key Vault, you follow these steps:
1. Register your application as an Azure AD application. (Access to key vaults is managed by
Azure AD.) This can be done through the Azure management portal.
Alternatively, if you want your application to authenticate using a certificate instead of a
password or client secret, you can use the New-AzADApplication PowerShell cmdlet. The
certificate that you register with Azure Key Vault needs only your public key. Your application
will use the private key.
2. Give the registered application access to the key vault by creating a new service principal. You
can do this using the following PowerShell commands:
$sp = New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId "<Application ID guid>"
Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName "<VaultName>" -ServicePrincipalName
$sp.ServicePrincipalNames[0] -PermissionsToSecrets all -ResourceGroupName "<KeyVault
Resource Group>"
3. Include the key vault as a configuration source in your application by calling the
AzureKeyVaultConfigurationExtensions.AddAzureKeyVault extension method when you create
an IConfigurationRoot instance.
Note that calling AddAzureKeyVault requires the application ID that was registered and given access
to the key vault in the previous steps. Or you can firstly running the Azure CLI command: az login,
then using an overload of AddAzureKeyVault that takes a DefaultAzureCredential in place of the
client.
332 CHAPTER 8 | Make secure .NET Microservices and Web Applications

Important
We recommend that you register Azure Key Vault as the last configuration provider, so it can override
configuration values from previous providers.

CHAPTER
.NET Microservices
Architecture key takeaways
As a summary and key takeaways, the following are the most important conclusions from this guide.
Benefits of using containers. Container-based solutions provide important cost savings because
they help reduce deployment problems caused by failing dependencies in production environments.
Containers significantly improve DevOps and production operations.
Containers will be ubiquitous. Docker-based containers are becoming the de facto standard in the
industry, supported by key vendors in the Windows and Linux ecosystems, such as Microsoft, Amazon
AWS, Google, and IBM. Docker will probably soon be ubiquitous in both the cloud and on-premises
datacenters.
Containers as a unit of deployment. A Docker container is becoming the standard unit of
deployment for any server-based application or service.
Microservices. The microservices architecture is becoming the preferred approach for distributed and
large or complex mission-critical applications based on many independent subsystems in the form of
autonomous services. In a microservice-based architecture, the application is built as a collection of
services that are developed, tested, versioned, deployed, and scaled independently. Each service can
include any related autonomous database.
Domain-driven design and SOA. The microservices architecture patterns derive from service-
oriented architecture (SOA) and domain-driven design (DDD). When you design and develop
microservices for environments with evolving business needs and rules, it’s important to consider DDD
approaches and patterns.
Microservices challenges. Microservices offer many powerful capabilities, like independent
deployment, strong subsystem boundaries, and technology diversity. However, they also raise many
new challenges related to distributed application development, such as fragmented and independent
data models, resilient communication between microservices, eventual consistency, and operational
complexity that results from aggregating logging and monitoring information from multiple
microservices. These aspects introduce a much higher complexity level than a traditional monolithic
application. As a result, only specific scenarios are suitable for microservice-based applications. These
include large and complex applications with multiple evolving subsystems. In these cases, it’s worth
investing in a more complex software architecture, because it will provide better long-term agility and
application maintenance.
334 CHAPTER 9 | .NET Microservices Architecture key takeaways

Containers for any application. Containers are convenient for microservices, but can also be useful
for monolithic applications based on the traditional .NET Framework, when using Windows
Containers. The benefits of using Docker, such as solving many deployment-to-production issues and
providing state-of-the-art Dev and Test environments, apply to many different types of applications.
CLI versus IDE. With Microsoft tools, you can develop containerized .NET applications using your
preferred approach. You can develop with a CLI and an editor-based environment by using the Docker
CLI and Visual Studio Code. Or you can use an IDE-focused approach with Visual Studio and its unique
features for Docker, such as multi-container debugging.
Resilient cloud applications. In cloud-based systems and distributed systems in general, there is
always the risk of partial failure. Since clients and services are separate processes (containers), a
service might not be able to respond in a timely way to a client’s request. For example, a service might
be down because of a partial failure or for maintenance; the service might be overloaded and
responding slowly to requests; or it might not be accessible for a short time because of network
issues. Therefore, a cloud-based application must embrace those failures and have a strategy in place
to respond to those failures. These strategies can include retry policies (resending messages or
retrying requests) and implementing circuit-breaker patterns to avoid exponential load of repeated
requests. Basically, cloud-based applications must have resilient mechanisms—either based on cloud
infrastructure or custom, as the high-level ones provided by orchestrators or service buses.
Security. Our modern world of containers and microservices can expose new vulnerabilities. There are
several ways to implement basic application security, based on authentication and authorization.
However, container security must consider additional key components that result in inherently safer
applications. A critical element of building safer apps is having a secure way of communicating with
other apps and systems, something that often requires credentials, tokens, passwords, and the like,
commonly referred to as application secrets. Any secure solution must follow security best practices,
such as encrypting secrets while in transit and at rest, and preventing secrets from leaking when
consumed by the final application. Those secrets need to be stored and kept safely, as when using
Azure Key Vault.
Orchestrators. Container-based orchestrators, such as Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Service
Fabric are key part of any significant microservice and container-based application. These applications
carry with them high complexity, scalability needs, and go through constant evolution. This guide has
introduced orchestrators and their role in microservice-based and container-based solutions. If your
application needs are moving you toward complex containerized apps, you will find it useful to seek
out additional resources for learning more about orchestrators.
