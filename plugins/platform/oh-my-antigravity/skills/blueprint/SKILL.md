description: Define a product/UI blueprint with durable decisions, interaction states, constraints, and verification hooks.
---
Run OmA `blueprint`.

Task:
$ARGUMENTS

Purpose:
Create a durable product and interface decision surface before implementation when UX, information architecture, visual hierarchy, or user workflow choices matter.

Protocol:
1. Keep this stage read-only unless the user explicitly asks to write the blueprint artifact.
2. Inspect existing product, UI, design-system, frontend, README, PRD, and taskboard context only as needed.
3. Separate firm decisions from assumptions and open questions.
4. Define the target users, primary workflows, content hierarchy, interaction states, empty/loading/error states, accessibility constraints, responsive behavior, and non-goals.
5. Map each decision to implementation owners, affected surfaces, and verification evidence.
6. If `.omg/state/taskboard.md` exists, reference relevant task IDs; otherwise propose task IDs that can be synced later.
7. If filesystem tools are available and the user requested persistence, write or update `.omg/state/blueprint.md`; otherwise return a copy-ready blueprint.
8. Do not start implementation from this command. Hand off to `team-plan`, `team-prd`, or `team-exec` after the blueprint is accepted.
