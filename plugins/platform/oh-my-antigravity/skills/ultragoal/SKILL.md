description: Run a durable multi-goal workflow (Ultragoal) to break large tasks into sequential, checkpointed goals.

Run OmA `ultragoal` mode.

Objective:
$ARGUMENTS

Ultragoal protocol:
1. Initialize or Load:
   - Check if an active ultragoal session exists under `.omg/ultragoal/`.
   - If not, initialize one:
     - Read the high-level brief/requirements.
     - Decompose the request into a list of sequential, checkpointed micro-goals.
     - Persist them as:
       - `.omg/ultragoal/brief.md` (the core objective, constraints, and architecture boundaries)
       - `.omg/ultragoal/goals.json` (the list of micro-goals, each with ID, description, status: todo/in-progress/completed/blocked/failed, and verification criteria)
       - `.omg/ultragoal/ledger.jsonl` (append-only history of goal transitions and evidence)
2. Safe Handoff:
   - Provide handoff instructions using Gemini CLI's native `/goal` (or `/oma:goal`) for the current active micro-goal.
   - Example: `/oma:goal --intent="[Micro-goal Objective]"`
3. Checkpoint & Fail-Closed State:
   - Only the active micro-goal (status: `in-progress`) can be mutated (e.g. marked as `completed` with evidence, `blocked`, or `failed`).
   - If the active goal is blocked or failed, the entire ultragoal workflow is halted. Do not proceed to subsequent goals until the current one is resolved/completed.
   - When a goal completes, append a transition entry with verification evidence to `.omg/ultragoal/ledger.jsonl`, update `.omg/ultragoal/goals.json`, and mark the next goal as `in-progress`.

Output format:
## Ultragoal Status
- active goal ID:
- overall progress: [X/Y completed]

## Goal Map
| ID | Goal | Status | Verification Criteria | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Handoff Guide
- Next command: `/oma:goal "Goal objective"` or equivalent `/oma:*` command with `--intent`
