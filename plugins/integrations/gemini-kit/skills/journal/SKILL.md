## PROGRESS JOURNAL MODE

### Entry: [Date]

#### What Was Done
- [Accomplishment 1]
- [Accomplishment 2]

#### Challenges Encountered
- [Challenge] → [How solved]

#### Lessons Learned
- [Key takeaway]

#### Next Steps
- [ ] [Action item 1]

## INCIDENT REPORT MODE

### 🚨 Incident Report: [Title]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Severity:** Critical / High / Medium / Low
**Duration:** [X hours/minutes]
**Tags:** #incident #[system] #[type]

#### Timeline
| Time | Event | Emotion |
|------|-------|---------|
| HH:MM | [Initial symptom] | 😱 Panic |
| HH:MM | [Investigation started] | 🔍 Focus |
| HH:MM | [Root cause identified] | 💡 Aha! |
| HH:MM | [Fix deployed] | 🤞 Hope |
| HH:MM | [Resolution confirmed] | 😮‍💨 Relief |

#### Root Cause
[Technical explanation of what went wrong]

#### Failed Attempts
1. [Attempt 1] - Why it didn't work
2. [Attempt 2] - Why it didn't work
3. [Attempt 3] - Why it didn't work

(Learning comes from what DIDN'T work!)

#### Final Fix
```[language]
// The fix that worked
```

#### Impact (Be Specific!)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Downtime | X hours |
| Users affected | Y users |
| Revenue impact | $X estimated |
| Support tickets | Z tickets |
| Data loss | Yes/No |

#### Cost Breakdown
```
Revenue lost:     $X
Engineering time: $Y (Z hours × $rate)
Support costs:    $W
Total impact:     $TOTAL
```

#### Why Monitoring Didn't Catch It
[Explain gap - this prevents future incidents!]

#### Preventive Measures
- [ ] [Action 1 to prevent recurrence]
- [ ] [Action 2 to prevent recurrence]
- [ ] [New monitoring/alerting]

#### Lessons Learned
⚠️ **Key Takeaways:**
1. [Lesson 1]

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Write immediately** - Emotional context fades fast
2. **Include failed attempts** - Learning = what didn't work
3. **Use real language** - "We screwed up" not "encountered issue"
4. **Show numbers** - $cost, time, impact metrics
5. **Add code snippets** - Error logs, broken → fixed
6. **Make searchable** - Use #tags for future lookup
7. **Blame the system** - Focus on process failures

---

## OUTPUT
Structured markdown, thorough but concise.
Blame the system, not individuals.
Include code snippets where relevant.
Make it searchable with tags.

> **Key Takeaway:** Transform expensive failures into permanent institutional knowledge. Learn once, don't fail repeatedly.
